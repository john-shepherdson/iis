This project is a patched version of 

**Cloudera's [Avro-JSON proxy for Hadoop Streaming](https://github.com/jwills/avro-json)**

The goal of this patch is to introduce a way of passing fully qualified names of classes that define the input and output schemas in the Oozie description. The default approach of this library is to accept either a full schema given in XML property or a path to a file stored somewhere in the filesystem.

**TODO**: **The text below is deprecated** - it's a leftover from the code before restructuring.
