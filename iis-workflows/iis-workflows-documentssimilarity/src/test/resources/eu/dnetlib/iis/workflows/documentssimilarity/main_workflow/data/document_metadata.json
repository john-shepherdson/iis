A Organização Mundial de Saúde alertou para a necessidade da diminuição do consumo desses ácidos graxos, o que culminou com a recomendação de sua eliminação em 2004. A rotulagem é uma medida que auxilia a população na escolha alimentar. Este artigo apresenta uma revisão sobre ácidos graxos trans, desde sua formação, efeitos para a saúde e as medidas atuais de controle da sua ingestão, enfatizando a rotulagem de alimentos. A busca de informações, relativa ao período de 1990 a 2012, foi realizada nos bancos de dados Scopus, PubMed, SciELO, Science Direct, Lilacs, bem como em sites oficiais nacionais e internacionais. Os unitermos utilizados em português e inglês foram: “ácidos graxos trans” e/ou “gordura hidrogenada”, conjugados à “rotulagem” e/ou “regulação” e/ou “legislação”. O controle dos ácidos graxos trans pode ser realizado pela diminuição de seu consumo por meio de medidas industriais, medidas individuais e coletivas, resultantes de um trabalho educativo, além de forças políticas. Em relação à rotulagem, mesmo existindo legislação brasileira que obrigue as indústrias a informarem a quantidade de ácidos graxos trans por porção em alimentos industrializados, observaram-se alguns questionamentos sobre como são disponibilizadas tais informações. Salienta-se que a efetiva diminuição dos ácidos graxos trans pode levar um tempo considerável, dada a adaptação cultural e tecnológica necessárias. Contudo, é uma medida importante, pois o resultado desse controle será a melhoria da saúde da população.","keywords":["Ácidos graxos trans","Hidrogenação","Legislação","Rotulagem nutricional"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::7566cf10c0ff5194b962c444edebc295","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Jane Mara Block"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::82c2d67a1f3f7bdea03ffb3bbbb39028","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Vanessa Martins Hissanaga"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::0d3011c3e4077f025f4b2be9a29c281f","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Rossana Pacheco da Costa Proença"}]}

Interjero kultūra ir privačiojo estetizmo tekstai | Preludes of Literary Modernism in Fin-de-siècle Vilnius: Interior Culture and Private Aestheticism Texts","abstract":"The genesis prerequisites of the early literary Modernism appear in Vilnius during the last decade of the 19th century when the city encountered the first manifestations of the cultural consciousness of the modern liberal bourgeoisie. The first publicist texts of the independent Russian media (in 1898 the daily Северо-Западное Слово started circulating), and the architectural discourse of the city (the stylistics of Vilnius Land Bank colonies) witness the classical liberal ideology of modernisation according to which the rational progress of civilisation harmoniously coincides with the individualistic values. The then still very scarce texts of Vilnius Russian and Polish literature and aesthetics were gradually moving away from the positivism of the 19th century towards the expression of modern individualism, bourgeois privacy, value liberalism, and aesthetic refinement. Vilnius literary texts generously depicted aesthetical interiors as private individual space, cultural shades from the dehumanising effect of technical progress (W. Benjamin). Aesthetical, closed interior turns into a semantically crucial space in the Vilnius novels Dwór w Haliniszkach (1903) and Z miłości (1903) by the Polish writer E. Jeleńska-Dmochowska. The private interior fantasies and the feeling of social isolation are clear features of mentality in novellas by the Vilnius Russian writer Yevgeny Shveder (Наброски и силуэты, 1904). The larger part of the early creative period of Kazys Puida should also be attributed to the melancholic discourse of the private aestheticism (Iš sermėgiaus krūtinės, 1906, Ruduo, 1906). The texts by the above authors sporadically demonstrated stylistic features of Parnassian and Decadent aestheticisms. The first collection of Polish poems published in the 20th century in Vilnius, the book Fale by Stanisława Szadurska (1906) also represented some melancholic features of the salon aesthetics and the classical French Parnassus. Still this culture of the liberal, cosmopolitan urban modernity and its literary representations in Vilnius, unlike in the centres of Western and Central European literature remained more fragmental and did not create any prominent conflict resistance to further development of the modern literary consciousness. Thus, they should be regarded as a sporadic prologue of such evolution although typologically these texts correspond to the processes in the large European fin-de-siècle cities.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::6bc35d22089fb8adffcb30d191179283","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Mindaugas Kvietkauskas"}]}

Gene expressions of iNOS and COX-2 were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The iNOS-dependent luciferase reporter was transfected for 24 h and the cells were treated with the reagents for 24 h, then the transcriptional activity of iNOS promoter was detected by luciferase assay. The production of NO was determined by diaminofluorescein-2.RESULTS: FYN significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2 compared with the control group in A549 cells (P＜0.01, P<0.01). Also, FYN inhibited the transcriptional activity of the iNOS promoter and reduced NO production compared with the control group (P＜0.01, P<0.01).CONCLUSION: These results suggest that FYN inhibits iNOS and COX-2 activation induced by TNF-α, therefore, it is expected to develop a new strategy to treat lung cancer.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::053ef08149be0721666d66f2d6391858","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Qing Wang"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::63f2b007960192f0b267a7b8636f029e","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Ju-yong Wang"}]}

The objective is to minimize the overall transmit power while guaranteeing the users' SINR constraints for every channel instantiation by designing the joint transmitreceive beamforming vectors robust to the channel uncertainty. This paper first investigates a multiuser MISO system (i.e., MIMO with single-antenna receivers) and by imposing the constraints on an SINR lower bound, a robust solution is obtained in a way similar to that with perfect CSI. We then present a reformulation of the  robust optimization problem using S-Procedure which enables us to obtain the globally optimal robust power control with fixed transmit beamforming. Further, we propose to find the optimal robust MISO beamforming via convex optimization and rank relaxation. A convergent iterative algorithm is presented to extend the robust solution for multiuser MIMO systems with both perfect and imperfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR) to guarantee the worst-case SINR. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed joint robust power and beamforming  optimization significantly outperforms the optimal robust power allocation with zeroforcing (ZF) beamformers, and more importantly enlarges the feasibility regions of a multiuser MIMO system.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::093e38f2c5e4439430f3d8b78b10ade9","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Kai-Kit Wong"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::19aad7445c1a0f84e5790531c046d8e5","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Gan Zheng"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::ec41f082c45f1d031d958eaa3109eb1b","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Tung-Sang Ng"}]}

The sheep are kept by women aged of 32.5 n 5.7 years, of the ethnic groups Mossi (80/) and Peul (20/). 75/ of the sheep are rams of Sahelian breed and 25/ are crossbreeds of Sahelian x Djalonke. The length of fattening period is 10 months on average starting at an age of 8 months and ending at 18 months. This period leads to the following expenses (in CFA francs, 1 CFA F = 0,01 French franc): purchase of the sheep (13,500 CFA F), veterinary treatments (5,000 CFA F), feed costs (15,000 CFA F), various expenses (3,350 CFA F), adding to an average total cost of 36,850 CFA F. The rams are sold to intermediate tradesmen in the village just before the Tabaski at an average price of 27,000 n 4,000 CFA F. The result shows on average a negative balance of 9,850 CFA F.

El análisis del ritual demuestra que la comunidad religiosa constituye el eje motriz del trasnacionalismo de los migrantes creyentes. En esta fiesta los seguidores de la minoría religiosa expresan su oposición al catolicismo dominante, al tiempo que exhiben su relación antagónica con las clases sociales hegemónicas de Guadalajara, Jalisco, lugar donde se originó la fe. El tiempo y espacio extraordinarios de la Santa Cena es útil para entender las inversiones simbólicas como las explica Victor Turner, las relaciones de poder, así como la posición de la Iglesia y de los fieles no privilegiados u oprimidos, frente al resto de la sociedad mexicana.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::38995e3555391145fe0a0e940632030a","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Patricia Fortuny Loret de Mola"}]}

This is a key region of dense shelf water formation from enhanced sea ice growth/brine rejection in the local coastal polynyas. In 2005, two seals occupied the continental shelf break near the grounded icebergs at the northern end of the Mertz Glacier Tongue for several weeks from the end of February. One of the seals migrated west to the Dibble Ice Tongue, apparently utilising the Antarctic Slope Front current near the continental shelf break. In 2010, immediately after that year's calving of the Mertz Glacier Tongue, two seals migrated to the same region but penetrated much further southwest across the Adélie Depression and sampled the Commonwealth Bay polynya from March through April. Here we present observations of the regional oceanography during the summer-fall transition, in particular (i) the zonal distribution of modified Circumpolar Deep Water exchange across the shelf break, (ii) the upper ocean stratification across the Adélie Depression, including alongside iceberg C-28 that calved from the Mertz Glacier and (iii) the convective overturning of the deep remnant seasonal mixed layer in Commonwealth Bay from sea ice growth. Heat and freshwater budgets to 200–300 m are used to estimate the ocean heat content (400→50 MJ m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;), flux (50–200 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; loss) and sea ice growth rates (maximum of 7.5–12.5 cm day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Mean seal-derived sea ice growth rates were within the range of satellite-derived estimates from 1992–2007 using ERA-Interim data. We speculate that the continuous foraging by the seals within Commonwealth Bay during the summer/fall transition was due to favorable feeding conditions resulting from the convective overturning of the deep seasonal mixed layer and chlorophyll maximum that is a reported feature of this location.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::1844cefd7cd40e62c43933fa69cfe7e1","firstname":"G.

The objective of this study was to investigate the invitro effects of aqueous, methanolic and hydroalcoholic extractsof cumin seed on HSV-1 growth in Vero cell line.Methods: Antiviral activity of various concentrations aqueous,hydroalcoholic and methanolic extracts of cumin seed in Verocells were studied using plaque reduction assays. The 50%cytotoxic concentration (CC50), 50% inhibitory concentration(IC50), and therapeutic index of the effective extracts were calculated.Results: Methanolic extract of cumin seed showed a significantantiviral activity on HSV-1 in Vero cell line. Its CC50 forVero cells, IC50 and the therapeutic index for HSV-1 were0.45, 0.18 mg/mL and 2.5, respectively. Aqueous and hydroalcoholicextracts of cumin seeds showed no inhibitory effecton HSV-1.Conclusion: The methanolic extract of cumin seed producesanti-HSV-1 effect. Probable interference of phenolic compoundswith fusion of Vero cell membrane and HSV-1 envelopemight be the mechanism of such inhibitory effect.

Prevalence of malaria was conducted from December 1995 to November, 1996 in human population of distract Karak (NWFP). The analysis showed that the overall incidence was higher (11.81 %) among the population which reared cattle than among those which did not (6.53%). The overall incidence of the disease was higher in autumn in cattle keeping population. However, comparison of prevalence of both species of Plasmodium (P. vivax & P.falciparum) revealed a positive correlation between parasite rates and the proportion of families owing cattle. This finding supports the prediction of the Sota-Mogi theoretical model that domestic animals can enhance rather than reduce malaria transmission when vectors are zoophilic.

MÉTODO: Trata-se de um questionário prospectivo enviado aos membros do Colégio Brasileiro de Cirurgiões (CBC). Dois mil questionários foram enviados obtendo-se 618 respostas (30,9%). O questionário constituía de perguntas relacionadas à experiência do cirurgião e ao tratamento da PA. RESULTADOS: Cento e oitente e dois entrevistados (33,6%) disseram tratar até cinco casos por ano e 147 (27,2%) tratam de seis a 10 casos por ano. Dentre os critérios utilizados para a definição de PA, o mais citado foi a avaliação clínica por 306 (57,4%) entrevistados, seguido dos critérios de Ranson por 294 (55,2%) e TC por 262 (49,2%). Com relação ao uso da TC, 275 (51,5%) entrevistados responderam que realizam a TC em todos os doentes com PA. O suporte nutricional parenteral foi o método de escolha indicado por 248 (46,6%) entrevistados. A infecção da coleção e/ou necrose pancreática é a principal indicação operatória com 447 (83,6%) respostas. O melhor período para operar um doente com PA grave foi considerado até quatorze dias por 278 (54,2%) entrevistados. Com relação aos antibióticos, 371 (68,6%) entrevistados disseram que utilizam antibióticos no tratamento da PA grave. CONCLUSÃO: Estes resultados demonstram uma ampla variação no tratamento da PA no Brasil.

Regarding the use of CT, 275 (51.5%) interviewed answered that make use of CT scan for all patients with AP. The parenteral nutritional support was the method of choice indicated for 248 (46.6%) interviewed. The infection of fluid collection and/or pancreatic necrosis was the main reason for surgical treatment with 447 (83.6%) answers. The optimum period to operate a patient with severe AP was considered up to seven days for 278 (54.2%) interviewed. With relation to antibiotics, 371 (68.6%) said that they use antibiotics in the treatment of severe AP. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate a wide variation in the treatment of AP in Brazil.

Smallholder farmers growing it face multiple challenges due to unorganized and inaccessible markets; they are forced to sell to intermediaries at very low prices. In response, the government of Uttarakhand introduced a minimum support price for Malta oranges; however, this failed to address farmers' problems due to poor implementation. This paper presents the results of an action research project with farmers in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand to develop farmers' resilience by upgrading their position in the Malta orange value chain, targeting production, processing, and marketing through community-based enterprise development. Information was collected before and after the intervention by various means, including stakeholder meetings, focus group discussions, and interviews with farmers and value chain facilitators. Activities supported by the research have contributed to increased productivity and farmer incomes. Farmers became better organized, and their bargaining power improved considerably. The enterprise-based upgrading process brought about an inclusive and pro-poor Malta orange value chain system with improved terms of engagement for smallholder farmers. The research results show that policy change, improved provision of technical and financial services, establishment of common facility centers, and strengthening of farmers' institutions are imperative to enable smallholder farmers to engage in value chains and thus increase their resilience.","keywords":["value chain","income","employment","Citrus sinensis","action research","Community-based enterprise","Value chain","Income","Employment","Action research","Uttarakhand"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::69a28a0cb994375242ec13aa3f14f808","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Dyutiman Choudhary"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::4e9c6ea2242de2253f23a99ccb5e2c26","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Mahendra Singh Kunwar"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::454576cf779d4a3dab7c18c2c148f04f","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Golam Rasul"}]}

No Pb pollution was detected in the inner bay, while in the outer bay and the mouth, light Pb pollution. The Pb pollution in the bay waters was area sources. Horizontal and vertical distribution, and seasonal change indicated the translocation of Pb in the waters. Pb entered the water body at marine surface and sank at the marine bottom. Understanding the variable process of Pb in the bay provided the scientific clues for controlling Pb pollution from the human activities.","keywords":["Heavy Metal Pb","Distribution","Seasonal Change","Pollution Source","Jiaozhou Bay"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::8cc8316f2a466dd31a8c9f7de03f2a40","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Yinjiang Zhang"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::6305d0c2481d16c17fda9d829d5d8ea4","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Ziru Ding"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::f2f492174e8c77e37dda7c8094d6819b","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Zhiguo Bu"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::8b0c2fb1484601a0d2c6f75e4da4bfb0","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Dongfang Yang"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::b520a1e9abaf658d92b63631908f03c2","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Junhui Guo"}]}

O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da adição de óleos ao acaricida cyhexatin sobre o ácaro Brevipalpus phoenicis e na retenção de calda por folhas de citros. Avaliou-se a mortalidade de ácaros, utilizando-se de frutos de laranja com uma arena circundada com cola entomológica para confinar os ácaros. Adotou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial, constituído pelos fatores: duas formulações de cyhexatin (WG e SC), dois tipos de óleo (mineral e vegetal) e duas concentrações dos óleos (0,5 e 1,0%), e mais dois tratamentos adicionais (acaricidas não adicionados de óleo) e uma testemunha sem aplicação. A aplicação dos produtos foi realizada sobre frutos de laranja até além do ponto de escorrimento. Logo após a aplicação, transferiram-se 10 ácaros B. phoenicis para cada fruto.A contagem dos ácaros vivos, mortos e retidos na barreira adesiva foi realizada um dia após a aplicação. Para a determinação da quantidade de calda retida, utilizaram-se folhas de laranjeira, que foram pulverizadas até além do ponto de escorrimento, adotando-se os mesmos tratamentos e o delineamento estatístico mencionados para a avaliação da mortalidade de ácaros, com exceção da testemunha sem aplicação. Determinou-se a massa de líquido retido após a aplicação dos produtos por folha, com auxílio de balança de precisão.

This southernmost part of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean is a typical high-latitude Antarctic region located in the circumpolar permanent pack-ice zone. It became accessible for large-scale scientific surveys only through the availability of modern ice-breaking research vessels, such as the German RV &ldquo;Polarstern&rdquo;. Here, we describe a dataset of the faunal composition and abundance of starfish, brittle star and sea cucumber assemblages in this area, based on collections from trawl catches carried out during three &ldquo;Polarstern&rdquo; cruises in 1983, 1984 and 1985. The set comprises a total of 4,509 records of abundances of 35 asteroid species (with a total of 2,089 specimens) and 38 ophiuroid species (with a total of 18,484 specimens) from 34 stations, as well as of 66 holothurian species (with a total of 20,918 specimens) from 59 stations including zero-abundances (absences). A synthesizing zoogeographical community analysis confirms the presence of three distinct assemblages of asteroids, ophiuroids, and holothurians with highest species richness on the eastern shelf. Overall, starfishes, brittle stars and sea cucumbers were present at all sites investigated in the study area but composition and abundance of asterozoan (asteroids and ophiuroids together) and holothurian fauna varied considerably. A synthesizing zoogeographical community analysis confirms the presence of three distinct assemblages of asteroids, ophiuroids, and holothurians with highest species richness on the eastern shelf. In the case of asterozoans, water depth and latitude seemed to be the most important drivers of assemblage distribution and composition. One of the holothurian assemblages was part of the rich macrozoobenthic community dominated by a diverse and abundant epifauna, mainly sponges and gorgonians. Another one was mainly composed of vagrant deposit-feeding species inhabiting a predominantly non-colonised substratum. In addition, a mixed holothurian assemblage was identified.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::6fc1296f9fc3ba542bc00733c5f2c78c","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Joachim Voß"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::f2239724a6f24397fed5c31bdc22256e","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Dieter Piepenburg"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::45d143de149e6b1a94caf2f072a69259","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Julian Gutt"}]}

Transient sources are formed by a Be star — the primary — and a neutron star X-ray pulsar — the secondary — and constitute a sub-class of X-ray binary systems. We will emphasize the discovery of low-energy indicators of high-energy processes. They are UBVRI magnitudes and Balmer lines of the optical companion. Particular unusual activity of the primary star — usually at the periastron passage of the neutron star – indicates that an X-ray flare is drawing near. The shape and intensity of X-ray outbursts are dependent on the strength of the activity of the primary. We derive the optical orbital period of the system as 110.856 ± 0.02 days. By using the optical flare of December 5, 1981 (here after 811205-E) that triggered the subsequent X-ray outburst of December 13, 1981, we derive the ephemeris of the system as JD Popt−outb = JD0 (2, 444, 944) ± n(110.856 ± 0.02). Thus the passage of the neutron star at the periastron occurs with a periodicity of 110.856 ± 0.02 days and the different kinds of X-ray outbursts of A0535+26 — following the definitions reported in the review by Giovannelli &amp; Sabau-Graziati (1992) — occur just after ∼ 8 days. The delay between optical and X-ray outbursts is just the transit time of the material coming out from the optical companion to reach the neutron star X-ray pulsar. The occurrence of X-ray “normal outbursts”, “anomalous outbursts” or “casual outbursts” is dependent on the activity of the Be star: “quiet state: steady stellar wind”, “excited state: stellar wind plus puffs of material”, and “expulsion of a shell”, respectively. In the latter case, the primary manifests a strong optical activity and the consequent strong X-ray outburst can occur in any orbital phase, with a preference at the periastron passage of the neutron star, because of its gravitational effects on the Be star.</p>","keywords":["X-ray/Be systems","X-ray pulsars","be stars","optical","spectroscopy","photometry","X-rays","individual: A0535+26 ? 1A 0535+26 ? 4U 0538+26 ? 1H 0536+263 ? 1RXS J053855.1+261843","individual: HDE 245770 ?

The cellulosic fiber was isolated from oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) using acid hydrolysis methods and, subsequently, homogenized using a high-pressure homogenizer to produce NFC. The structural analysis and the crystallinity of the raw fiber and extracted cellulose were carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphology and thermal stability were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses, respectively. The FTIR results showed that lignin and hemicellulose were removed effectively from the extracted cellulose nanofibrils. XRD analysis revealed that the percentage of crystallinity was increased from raw EFB to microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), but the decrease for NFC might due to a break down the hydrogen bond. The size of the NFC was determined within the 5 to 10 nm. The TGA analysis showed that the isolated NFC had high thermal stability. The finding of present study reveals that combination of sulphuric acid hydrolysis and high-pressure homogenization could be an effective chemo-mechanical process to isolate cellulose nanofibers from cellulosic plant fiber for reinforced composite materials.","keywords":["nanofibrillated cellulose","oil palm empty fruit bunch","high pressure homogenization","acid hydrolysis","composite materials"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::3b13bc429c8fb199356865b3ff0fb4a9","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Rudi Dungani,"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::4a21912828c959c1865cb2fad86e333d","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Yalda Davoudpour"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::14d6b2726db2e43a6cd1b1dfeae9db02","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Md.

It usually develops in long bones but can also occur in unusual locations. The common presenting symptom is increasing pain at the tumor site. Standard treatment ranges from curettage to wide resection, with reports of varying oncological and functional results. The recurrence rate is high during the first 2-3 years after surgery regardless of pre-operative tumor stage.

As neuro-skeletal dysmorphisms, the occipito-cervical malformations belong to the neurodysplastic group. They are classified as skeletal anomalies, associated nervous malformations and meningeal reactions. Vertebralization of the occipital bone and occipitalization of atlas, subluxation of odontoid process, dysplasia of the occipital bone, dystrophia brevicollis and other anomalies are discussed. Special care is given to the study of basilar impression; its concept, history, incidence, clinical and neurological symptoms, radiological characterization (craniographic, perimyelographic and iodoventriculographic aspects) and surgical treatment are reviewed. The authors report five cases of occipito-cervical malformations, which are the first references in Brazilian literature. In case 1 the anomalies (manifestation of occipital vertebra and Arnold-Chiari deformity) were disclosed at an operation for cisticercosis of the posterior fossa. In the following four cases invagination of the basilar portion of the occipital bone (basilar impression) could be radiologically demonstrated; in case 2 a suboccipital craniectomy and a laminectomy of atlas and axis were performed but the patient died a week later and the necroscopic examination confirmed the neuro-skeletal anomalies. In all cases there were several associated malformations. In case 2 there were occipitalization of the atlas, fusion of the first and second cervical vertebrae, supernumerary rib of the seventh cervical vertebra, supernumerary lumbar vertebra, and Arnold-Chiari deformity; at necropsy it was found a syringomyelic cyst on the cervical cord and a fibrous dural ring over the foramen magnum. Case 3 showed the syndrome of Klippel-Feil, besides supernumerary ribs of the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, Arnold-Chiari malfotmation and probable aplasia of cell groups in the nuclei of oculomotor and facial nerves. In case 4 there were occipitalization of atlas and Chiari deformity. In case 5 vertebral reduction in the cervical region was evidenced but bony coalescence could not be proved. In the last four cases the constitutional morphologic type was determined. Electroencephalograms of cases 3, 4 and 5 showed no abnormalities; in case 1 slow bilateral occipital waves were recorded. The authors call attention to the importance of the diagnosis of these anomalies susceptible of successful surgical correction, which can simulate many nervous diseases of untoward course, like lateral amyotrophic sclerosis, syringomyelia (which can be actually associated to the bony anomaly, as in case 2), sclerosis of dorsal funiculi of the spinal cord, tabes, multiple sclerosis, heredocerebellar ataxia, etc. The authors also stress the clinico-radiological differences between basilar impression and platybasia, frequently taken as synonyms. Although both anomalies may coexist (as in cases 4 and 5) their association is not an absolute rule; on the contrary, in case 2 the basal angle was in the inferior limit of normality and in case 3 it was much lower. Emphasis is put on the value of the Chamberlain's line and chiefly in the McGregor basal line for the correct diagnosis of basilar invagination of the occipital bone.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::04a90860c30c81caeef9c75ccac4a506","firstname":"Rolando A.","secondnames":["Tenuto"],"fullname":"Rolando A.

In this paper we develop an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure based on the characteristic function.

The amino acid sequences of HCRG1 and HCRG2 identified using the Edman degradation method share up to 95% of their identity with the representatives of the HCGS polypeptide multigene subfamily derived from H. crispa cDNA. Polypeptides are characterized by positively charged Arg at the N-terminus as well as P1 Lys residue at their canonical binding loop, identical to those of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). These polypeptides are shown by our current evidence to be more potent inhibitors of trypsin than the known representatives of the HCGS subfamily with P1Thr. The kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of the intermolecular interactions between inhibitors and serine proteases were determined by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method. Residues functionally important for polypeptide binding to trypsin were revealed using molecular modeling methods. Furthermore, HCRG1 and HCRG2 possess anti-inflammatory activity, reducing tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretions, as well as proIL-1β expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages.

O LCR é, por assim dizer, uma solução salina bicarbonatada à qual se juntam pequenas quantidades de outros componentes iônicos e moleculares. Admite-se que a barreira hemato-encefálica protege o sistema nervoso central contra as variações súbitas do equilíbrio hidrogênio-iônico. Ela apresenta uma lenta permeabilidade às variações de concentrações dos iontes HCO3-, Cl-, H+, Na+, de que resulta proteção do pH do LCR, e fácil permeabilidade ao gás CO2 de sorte a favorecer rápidos ajustes com o sangue. Estes fatos explicam porque, por vezes, podem ser observadas variações divergentes do pH de um lado e de outro da barreira. Por motivo de sua importante função fisiológica na regulação da respiração, o LCR está muito bem protegido em relação à estabilidade de seu pH. Além disto o pH do LCR indica mais fielmente as modificações ácido-básicas do tecido cerebral que o pH do sangue. Os distúrbios graves do controle hidrogênio-iônico determinam perturbações da função cerebral com manifestações neurológicas e psíquicas. Por estes motivos as determinações do pH, pCO2, e CO2 total do LCR têm uma grande importância para a interpretação dos problemas fisiopatológicos que ocorrem no sistema nervoso central, para o conseqüente diagnóstico e para a correta indicação terapêutica. Pouco se sabe sobre as perturbações da função do sistema nervoso central em pacientes com acidose metabólica; já se tem descrito distúrbios neurológicos e mentais em pacientes com alcalose respiratória e alcalose metabólica; entretanto, é em relação à acidose respiratória que a literatura é mais extensa. Na acidose respiratória decorrente da insuficiência ventilatória pulmonar grave pode-se observar uma síndrome de hipertensão endocraniana devida à ação vasodilatadora do CO2 e estes pacientes são por vezes encaminhados aos serviços neurológicos com a suspeita de tumor encefálico. O propósito do presente trabalho foi o de determinar a relação cloretos/ CO2 total no LCR normal e no LCR de pacientes neurológicos com distúrbios mais comuns do controle hidrogênio-iônico, para se poder avaliar o seu valor prático no exame de rotina. O material deste estudo é constituído por 58 observações, sendo 37 de pessoas normais e 21 de pacientes com distúrbios graves do controle hidrogênio-iônico, dos quais 11 apresentavam acidose respiratória e 10 acidose metabólica decorrente de coma diabético. Em condições normais, a relação cloretos/CO2 total no LCR está compreendida entre os valores de 4.8 a 5.8. Nos distúrbios do controle hidrogênio-iônico, particularmente naqueles casos crônicos e graves, verificam-se alterações das taxas de cloretos e de CO2 total, cujas concentrações variam de modo compensatório, umas em sentido oposto às outras, nestes ajustamentos ácido-básicos. Na acidose respiratória o LCR apresenta acentuada diminuição da taxa de cloretos com aumento compensatório da concentração do CO2 total. Nestes casos a relação variou de 2.0 a 4.7. Na acidose metabólica, como exemplo aquela que ocorre em pacientes em coma diabético, observa-se diminuição acentuada da concentração do CO2 total e aumento da taxa de cloretos. Nestes casos, os valores da relação cloretos/CO2 total estavam compreendidos entre 6.5 a 22.<br>The response of the cerebrospinal fluid pH to changes in the blood is of considerable physiological and clinical interest. The role of the cerebrospinal fluid in the control of pulmonary ventilation is pointed out. The main aspects of the neurologic manifestations and the cerebrospinal fluid changes in patients with hydrogen ion disturbances are discussed. The purpose of this paper is the study of the chloride/total CO2 ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid. In 37 normal individuals the ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8. In 11 patients with respiratory acidosis it ranged between 2.0 and 4.7. In 10 patients with metabolic acidosis due to severe diabetic coma the ratio ranged between 6.5 and 22. It is emphasized the importance of this simple test in the cerebrospinal fluid of neurologic patients with hydrogen ion disturbances.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::0593675e3dc06b506a87331ee988c518","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Antonio Bei"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::06b0351e8729e038ba267961ed87813a","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"João Baptista dos Reis Filho"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::03439ecddd5f23f6f8941e28a88d12c5","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"João Baptista dos Reis"}]}

Flood forecasting tools and early warning systems can be very\nbeneficial to reducing flood risk. Event-based rainfall–runoff models are\nfrequently employed for operational flood forecasting purposes because of\ntheir simplicity and the reduced number of parameters involved with respect\nto continuous models. However, the advantages related to the reduced\nparameterization oppose to the need of a correct initialization of the\nmodel, especially in areas characterized by strong climate seasonality. In\nthis case, the use of continuous models could be desirable but it is very\nproblematic in poorly gauged areas where continuous rainfall and temperature\ndata are not available. This paper introduces a Simplified Continuous\nRainfall–Runoff model (SCRRM), which uses globally available soil moisture\nretrievals to identify the initial wetness condition of the catchment, and,\nonly event rainfall data to simulate discharge hydrographs. The model\ncalibration involves only three parameters. For soil moisture, besides in situ data,\nsatellite products from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) and the Advanced\nMicrowave Scanning Radiometer for Earth observation (AMSR-E) sensors were\nemployed. Additionally, the ERA-Land reanalysis soil moisture product of the\nEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) was used.\n<br><br>\nSCRRM was tested in the small catchment of the Rafina River, 109 km<sup>2</sup>,\nlocated in the eastern Attica region, Greece. Specifically, sixteen recorded\nrainfall–runoff events were simulated by considering the different\nindicators for the estimation of the initial soil moisture conditions from in\nsitu, satellite and reanalysis data. By comparing the performance of the\ndifferent soil moisture products, we conclude that: (i) all global indicators\nallow for a fairly good reproduction of the selected flood events, providing\nmuch better results than those obtained from setting constant initial\nconditions; (ii) the use of all the indicators yields similar results when\ncompared with a standard continuous simulation approach that, however, is\nmore data demanding; (iii) SCRRM is robust since it shows good performances\nin validation for a significant flood event that occurred on February 2013\n(after calibrating the model for small to medium flood events). Due to the\nwide diffusion of globally available soil moisture retrievals and the limited\nnumber of parameters used, the proposed modelling approach is very suitable\nfor runoff prediction in poorly gauged areas.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::050fa3f23c20a449476913067ac94588","firstname":"L.","secondnames":["Brocca"],"fullname":"L.

The stiff global competition faced by these companies necessitates a need to embark on radical strategies in the form of World Class manufacturing philosophies to survive, make profit and remain competitive. While companies in developing countries strive to adopt these World Class Manufacturing (WCM) philosophies into their production process, there is often lack of a measure on their progress towards world class manufacturing status besides the improvement in productivity. This paper’s focus is on how companies can assess their progress in terms of achieving a world class manufacturing status. The research starts with an assessment of the world class status of the company that has adopted best manufacturing practices. A Current State Radar Chart (CSRC) is drawn to see the company’s position on the radar. Researches methods (questionnaires, interviews, company audit) are used to identify wastes according to WCM. WCM techniques were used to minimise wastes. A Future State Radar Chart (FSRC) is drawn to assess the improvements made. The company was operating its margarine production process at 35% of a world class process. The major waste identified was the downtime. Downtime contributed to 74% of the total available time leaving production only 26% of the available time. WCM techniques realised a reduction in downtime by 30% and increased the available time for production to 56%. These changes achieved a 56% of a world class process on the FRC drawn.","keywords":["Lean manufacturing","Margarine Production","World Class Manufacturing."],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::a1181fabcc36abbecd15b6d002073ff0","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Tom Chuma,"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::00af5c1c43b2239625560134fab5bbd1","firstname":"Chasara","secondnames":["T"],"fullname":"T., Chasara,"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::8f5d130b151ffd6a8f6852aa1f438cf3","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"O.

The aim of this study is to show a novel quality control by GC/SAW methodology for the discrimination of the three different parts of the plant such as leaves, aerial stems, and underground stems for H. cordata Thunb. Sixteen compounds were identified. β-Myrcene, cis-ocimene and decanal are the dominant volatiles for leaves (71.0%) and aerial stems (50.1%). While, monoterpenes (74.6%) are the dominant volatiles for underground stems. 2-Undecanone (1.3%) and lauraldehyde (3.5%) were found to be the characteristic components for leaves. Each part of the plant has its own characteristic fragrance pattern owing to its individual chemical compositions. Moreover, its individual characteristic fragrance patterns are conducive to discrimination of the three different parts of the plant. Consequently, fast GC/SAW can be a useful analytical method for quality control of the different parts of the plant with pharmacological volatiles as it provides second unit analysis, a simple and fragrant pattern recognition.","keywords":["gas chromatography/surface acoustic wave sensor","Houttuynia cordata Thunb","fragrance pattern recognition","quality control"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::3ee6ff4f0c30788d4ce036ccaa2435cb","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Se Yeon Oh"}]}

Os resultados mostraram que embora o extrato de C. americana não tenha modificado a sobrevivência bacteriana (p > 0,05), provocou aumento significativo (p < 0,05) na indução do profago &#955;, especialmente nas concentrações mais altas. Assim, concluiu-se que o extrato etanólico das cascas de C. americana não apresentou atividade citotóxica, mas foi observada ação genotóxica direta.","keywords":["Curatella americana","Lixeira","Citotoxicidade","Genotoxicidade","Indução lisogênica","Cytotoxicity","Genotoxicity","Lysogenic induction"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::f478b11f30eaf21e6cfb7b9029c5904f","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Laryssa Silva de Andrade"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::7fcbef814873874d9697186ab5daa02d","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Lee Chen Chen"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::3b629ecdd32b161b0fdf2f9236aaf628","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Juliana Brandstetter Vilar"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::cecc829fed9b80065c70cb8c1ddf8d23","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Kaio Ramos Leite"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::41bda2d77937f35cde3d638767350d3a","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Heleno Dias Ferreira"}]}

Five sixteenth-century printed texts are investigated, taken from the Repertory of Middle-Dutch artes-literature by R. Jansen-Sieben. The texts are studied from a literary point of view. Besides an analysis of form and contents, it is asked what was the function of those texts, to what kind of audience they directed themselves, and who were the author(s) and/or publishers. Moreover, it is asked whether these texts form a distinct genre and how far they can be regarded as part of the (liberal or mechanical) arts. Two of the five texts that are the subject of this study have a religious function: the disaster is regarded as a sign of God and the text calls people to repent. Two other texts are simple eyewitness accounts where the religious intention is lacking. The last text is a mixture of both. In spite of these differences, it is warranted to regard the texts as artes-literature. They are reports of a recent event, aiming at information and instruction. It is quite probable that the Reformation and the millenaristic expectations of the sixteenth century contributed to the spectacular rise in interest in texts on natural disasters, both in the Netherlands and abroad. 207&lt;/p&gt;","keywords":["Natural disasters","Texts","Religion","16th century"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::7600060be900905b4c560be1b2a0b75f","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Lenny Veltman"}]}

The main task of a network is to receive information from node and transmit to base station for processing. Ifall nodes forward data packets directly to base station, they will drain their energy quickly. So, routing has to be performed to forward packets from source to destination. This paper proposes Bee Hive Optimization (BHO) approach for increasing the lifetime of WSN. BHO is an algorithm which is used to find the optimized path and thereby improve the efficiency of the network. BHO generates new path by taking energy as the fitness value to analyze different paths and select best optimized path whose energy consumption is very low compared to other paths. The result obtained by performing this operation in BHO is better than compared to other algorithms like ACO and PSO. It creates a better impact in performance in WSN.","keywords":["Optimization","Wireless Sensor Networks","Energy Consumption","Bee Hive","Routing."],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::190b8832b36c206327f3439f1c5cdb67","firstname":"P.

As formas de angioedema com deficiência de C1-INH são divididas em hereditárias e adquiridas. A terapêutica pode ser direcionada aos ataques agudos ou profilaxia de novos episódios. O tratamento de escolha é feito através de hormônios masculinizantes, podendo também ser indicado os inibidores da ativação do cininogênio e do plasminogênio como o ácido tranexâmico ou o ácido e-aminocapróico e a reposição de concentrado de C1-INH. O presente estudo relata a evolução de 10 pacientes (quatro famílias) acometidos por HAE e as peculiaridades do tratamento utilizado em cada caso. MÉTODOS: Dez pacientes (1-38 anos) com HAE foram diagnosticados através de história clínica e exames laboratoriais. Os testes realizados para avaliação do sistema complemento foram: dosagem sérica de C1-INH, C4 e C3 e ensaio hemolítico (CH50 e APH50) para as vias clássica e alternativa. O tratamento foi indicado de acordo com a gravidade dos sintomas, idade, sexo e resposta terapêutica. RESULTADOS: A avaliação clínica evidenciou 4/10 pacientes com edema subcutâneo recorrente; 3/10 pacientes com edema de laringe prévio e 3/10 pacientes com sintomas esporádicos. Sintomas de gravidade diferentes foram evidenciados na mesma família. A avaliação laboratorial (dosagem sérica) demonstrou: níveis de C1-INH diminuídos em 10/10; níveis diminuídos de C4 8/10; níveis indetectáveis de CH50 em 3/10 e diminuídos em 6/10; níveis diminuídos de APH50 em 2/10. 6/10 pacientes não receberam tratamento específico, sendo que dois deles apresentam alto risco para asfixia; uma adolescente tem sido controlada com ácido e-aminocapróico, uma criança que fazia uso de danazol passou a receber ácido tranexâmico, uma paciente de 30 anos recebe oxandrolona e um homem de 38 anos está em tratamento com danazol. CONCLUSÃO: Apesar do HAE ser causado pelo mesmo defeito e acometer membros da mesma família, diferentes critérios têm sido estabelecidos para o tratamento desses pacientes. Foram indicados diferentes esquemas terapêuticos para HAE e alguns dos pacientes puderam ser seguidos sem terapia medicamentosa.<br>PURPOSE: Hereditary Angioedema was first described by William Osler in 1888 and it is caused by a hereditary or acquired deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). Treatment is indicated for acute attacks or prophylaxis of angioedema which occur in the subcutaneous tissue respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Treatment includes attenuated androgens, inhibitors of kininogen or plasminogen, like tranexamic acid or e-aminocaproic acid and the administration of C1-INH concentrate. We describe the peculiarities of the treatment chosen for 10 patients (4 families) with HAE and their evolution. METHODS: Ten patients (1-38 years old) with HAE were diagnosed by clinical history and laboratory evaluation. The following tests were performed for the complement system: C1-INH, C4 and C3 levels and hemolytic assay (CH50 and APH50) for the classic and alternative pathways. Treatment was initiated considering severity of symptoms, age, gender and therapeutic response of the patient. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation showed: 4/10 patients with recurrent subcutaneous edema; 3/10 with previous laryngeal edema and 3/10 with sporadic symptoms. Different severity of symptoms was verified in the same family. The laboratory evaluation detected: low C1-INH levels (10/10); low serum C4 level (8/10); undetectable CH50 (3/10) and low CH50 levels (6/10); low APH50 levels (2/10). Six out of ten patients did not receive any specific treatment and 2 of them had high risk of asphyxia. One adolescent had been controlled with e-aminocaproic acid, one child had been changed from danazol to tranexamic acid, a 30 year old female patient had received oxandrolone and a 38 year old man had been treated with danazol. CONCLUSIONS: Although HAE is caused by the same defect and affects members of the same family, various approaches have been taken to treat these patients. We observed different alternatives of prophylactic therapy for HAE, of which some did not require drug therapy.","keywords":["Angioedema hereditário","Deficiência de inibidor de C1 esterase (C1-INH)","Tratamento","Hereditary angioedema","C1-INH deficiency","Treatment of HAE"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::83a7435ca9b63aa1dbabae76cb5106ef","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Michael Kirschfink"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::1e596961c441a6fef08c1950289ab458","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Dewton Moraes Vasconcelos"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::7ce9d634329bc49b49bf2e783c8d295c","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Maria Elisa Bertocco Andrade"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::2211fa0df9734b33f3cb0d197416055c","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Anete Sevciovic Grumach"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::1377fc36a335e573b127fb14f0f25839","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Alberto José da Silva Duarte"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::ed06f2ebd0fb7062476dacb695503056","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Viviana Galimbert Arruk"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::7c3ac4d41eaeb9b4772adb1e0bf5485f","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Kélem de Nardi Chagas"}]}

One of the key mechanism underlying ecological insurance is that niche differentiation allows asynchronous responses to fluctuating environments; although, the role of different ecological strategies (e.g. specialists vs generalists) has yet to be formally evaluated.  We combine here a simple model and experimental study to illustrate how different specialization-performance strategies shape the biodiversity-insurance relationship.  We assembled microcosm of generalists and specialist bacteria over a gradient of salinity and found that, bacterial communities made up of generalists were more productive and more stable over time under environmental fluctuations.  We argue that beyond species richness itself, it is essential to incorporate the distribution of ecological strategies across relevant environmental gradients as predictors of the insurance potential of biodiversity in natural ecosystems.","keywords":["Insurance","evolution","Biodiversity","functioning","bacterial microcosms"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::9e02a0cf0d48d734d075a2a03cb62475","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"MiguelMatias"}]}

Having considered those constraints, this paper aimed to analyse the website from two different views: (1) critical applied linguistics  (CAL) aspects and (2) critical  discourse analysis (CDA). After analysing the website using CAL and CDA, it was found that the website was adequate for beginner, in which it provided fun learning through games as well as challenged learners’ to test their vocabulary. Despite of these strengths, there were several issues required further thinking in terms of learners’ broad knowledge, such as, some of learning materials focused on states in America. It was quite difficult for EFL learners if they did not have adequate general knowledge. Thus, the findings implied that the website could be used as a supporting learning material, which accompanied textbooks and vocabulary exercise books.","keywords":null,"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::03b9f14cf5881b4980ba13bbf721cdbf","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Rina Agustina"}]}

Propõe-se, aqui, uma teoria humanista do conhecimento, na qual as três espécies de silogismo - entimema, dialético e demonstrativo - são consideradas complementares no processo de instituição dos conhecimentos, com base em critérios próprios das metodologias ou regras do fazer ou algoritmos reconhecidos pelos grupos sociais que as sustentam. Tais regras do fazer ou algoritmos não constituem uma lógica natural, uma vez que qualquer lógica é um cálculo. Os algoritmos para a produção de conhecimentos encontram-se na relação inseparável entre o orador (ethos), o auditório (pathos) e o discurso (lógos), na qual são validados os argumentos. Donde, uma teoria humanista do conhecimento permite a sublimação da referida 'dispersão epistemológica', isso porque deixa explícita as situações nas quais um conhecimento é validado.

Such rules of doing or algorithms do not constitute a natural logic, since any logic is a calculation. The algorithms for the production of knowledge are found in the indissoluble relation between the orator (ethos), the audience (pathos) and the discourse (logos), where the arguments are validated. Hence, a humanist theory of knowledge allows the sublimation of the above-mentioned \"epistemological dispersion\", for it makes explicit the situations in which a piece of knowledge is validated. Thus, the methodologies are reasonable guarantees, but do not determine reliable knowledge, because its guarantors are the social groups that admit and support it.","keywords":["Ciências do Homem","Ciências da Educação","Teoria humanista do conhecimento","Retórica","Sciences of Man","Sciences of Education","Humanist theory of knowledge","Rhetoric"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::39641a94145ce5b140cc3af53df8542c","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Tarso Mazzotti"}]}

The research was based on the geoprocessing techniques and on the use of Landsat-5 images, on field work data and on questionnaires applied to the rural families. The results had indicated the existence of land degradation levels since very low until very serious, with which desertification nuclei are related. The agricultural lands are compromised by the deforestation and the maintenance of a cattle-raising above the support capacity of the caatinga. Such practical are responsible for the appearance of the erosions that provokes the desertification process in severe stage as the nuclei of desertification. The results had also indicated that the levels of land degradation, in few places, had presented some recovery, however in general the areas of its occurrence had increased.

A large proportion of retinal glycerophospholipids, especially those found in photoreceptor membranes, are dipolyunsaturated molecular species. Among them, dipolyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species are known to contain very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFA) from the n-3 and n-6 series having 24-36 carbon atoms and four to six double bonds. Recent interest in the role played by VLC-PUFA arose from the findings that a protein called Elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids 4 (ELOVL4) is involved in their biosynthesis and that mutations in the ELOVL4 gene are associated with Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (STGD3), a dominantly inherited juvenile macular degeneration leading to vision loss. In this context, PC molecular species containing VLC-PUFA in retina must be precisely characterized to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of STGD3. For 25 years, several current approaches using gas chromatography or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry have been used for the characterisation and quantification of VLC-PUFA. These methods allowed characterizing with precision the structures (carbon chain length and double bond positions) of the different VLC-PUFA in bovine retina. Thus, retinal C28-C36 fatty acids are polyunsaturated and belong to the n-3 and n-6 families. The n-6 family of C28-C36 fatty acids has four or five double bonds, while the n-3 family of VLC-PUFA contains five or six double bonds. Moreover, some studies allowed determining the position of VLC-PUFA in the VLC-PC species. But most of these conventional approaches are timeconsuming, requiring successive extraction, chromatographic steps and often a derivatization step before. Recently, a normal LC-ESI-MS/MS method was proposed for the structural characterization and the quantification of VLC-PC species in retinas from bovines and human donors. It directly analyses phospholipids as intact molecules and preserves the information based on the relative position of acyl radicals on the glycerol backbone. Since the results from molecular and biochemical studies led to the conclusion that VLC-PUFA are involved in the pathogenesis of STGD3, this specific and accurate method may be useful to more precisely investigate the molecular mechanisms leading to photoreceptor dysfunction and death in STD3.","keywords":["very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids","phosphatidylcholine","retina","Stargardt-like macular dystrophy type 3: STGD3","gas chromatography-mass spectrometry","liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::5f63d4df6e7dc9e8590874fa7d001cb8","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Acar Niyazi"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::011564453c315cfe15cc0f762713c733","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Berdeaux Olivier"}]}

Ratos Wistar foram pré-tratados oralmente com EHA (30, 100,300 e 1000 mg/kg) antes da indução de lesões gástricas por etanol 70% (0,5 mL/animal, v.o.), indometacina (20 mg/kg, s.c.) e estresse por contenção e hipotermia (durante 3 h a 4 ºC). O EHA protegeu a mucosa gástrica contra lesões induzidas por etanol, porém não protegeu contra as lesões induzidas por indometacina e estresse. Quando o EHA foi administrado pela via intraduodenal (i.d.), o volume, o pH e a acidez total da secre��ão gástrica de ratos com ligadura de piloro não foram alterados com diferentes doses do extrato. Os resultados obtidos sugerem um efeito citoprotetor contra ação necrosante direta do etanol pelo extrato bruto hidroalcoólico da Persea major e este efeito não está relacionado com a redução da secreção ácida gástrica.","keywords":["Persea major","Lauraceae","gastroprotetor","etanol","gastroprotective","ethanol"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::649bfc16a7bf43c92b9a1e560e175913","firstname":"Maria Consuelo A.","secondnames":["Marques"],"fullname":"Maria Consuelo A.

An investigation was taken up to find out the activity of proteolysis by <i>Bacillus </i>species under controlled condition. Attempts were made to isolate <i>Bacillus </i>species from three samples such as water, egg granules and flavour juice. The microbial load was found to be more in water samples followed by egg granules and it was least in flavour juice samples. A total of seven isolates were obtained from these samples and were designated as WB-1, WB-2, EB-1, EB-2, JMB, JLB and JGB. The isolated bacteria were characterized based on their morphological, culture characteristics and biochemical tests. Further, the results were compared with the Bergey`s manual of Determinative Bacteriology, which showed <i>Bacillus cereus</i>. The activity of proteolysis was studied by using two different media such as albumin agar and skim milk agar. The results revealed that skim milk agar medium was found to be higher in term of the formation of halo zone around colonies than albumin agar medium. The formation of halo zone around colonies in the media indicated that proteins were hydrolyzed by the bacteria. Among the different strains tested for the activity, WB-2 was found to the best followed by WB-1 and least by JGB in both media.

Despite the widespread use of antithrombotic drugs for the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thrombosis, thromboembolic diseases continue to be a major cause of death and disability worldwide. This shows the researchers′ inefficiency in searching efficacious and safe antithrombotic drugs. The researchers have reached to the basic mechanism of thrombus formation and by interrupting various steps of this mechanism, they can prevent as well as treat thromboembolic disorders. In continuation of Aspirin, now, the researchers are using clopedogrel, Ticlopidine and GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors (Abciximab, Tirofiban and Eptifibatide). Warfarin is an old antithrombotic drug, which is still being used but due to various side effects and drug interactions, they are bound to use newer drugs. Newer antiplatelet drugs include prasugrel, ticagrelor, cangrelor and elinogrel whereas newer thrombin inhibitors are Ximelgatran and Dabigatran. Apixaban and edoxaban are also newer entry in this category as Factor Xa inhibitors. Idrabiotaparinux is an indirect inhibitor of Xa as it accelerates the activity of antithrombin.

MS is increasing among adolescents. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of MS in 11-18 years old Birjandi school children in 2012.\nMaterials and Methods: This cross–sectional study was conducted on 2394 eleven-eighteen years old school children in Birjand (1304 girls and 1090 boys) through Multiple-Cluster Sampling. Height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured by standard methods. Blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured after a 12-hour fasting. MS was defined according to the modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Data were analyzed by the SPSS software (ver. 16) using statistical T test, logistic regression and Chi square at P<0.05.\nResults: According to this study, 6.9% of adolescents (4.5% of females and 9.9% of males) had MS. Occurrence rate of MS in male students was 2.32 times of female ones.\nComponents of MS included low HDL (27.7%), hypertriglyceridemia (23.7%), central obesity (16.2%), systolic hypertension (9.4%), diastolic hypertension (0.9%), and high FBS (0.6%). This study showed a significant relationship between MS, and overweight, obesity and central obesity. 48.5% of the adolescents had at least one component of MS.\nConclusions: MS has a high prevalence in Birjandi adolescents, particularly in the obese ones.

The present research was conducted to evaluate five rice varieties for salinity tolerance at seedling stage.\nMethods: Experiment was conducted in triplicate and in two sets. One set was grown as a control (non-stress) and other as salt stressed. Salt stress of 15 dS/m was applied to one set of rice seedlings under controlled conditions. Data for different growth related morpho-physiological traits, i.e. germination percentage, root and shoot length, seedling fresh and dry weight, Na+ and K+ uptake were recorded after 15 days of seedling emergence under control as well as salinity condition.\nResults: Significant differences were observed among the genotypes under both the treatments and interaction of the evaluated traits suggested a significant variability among the rice genotypes under salt stress. NIAB-IRRI-9, Basmati-198 and KSK-133 were proved to be relatively salt tolerant varieties as they showed good performance for the recorded parameters. However, Basmati-385 was observed a salt sensitive variety due to highest reduction in seedling fresh and dry weight along with the maximum Na+ uptake.\nConclusion: Based on obtained results, it was concluded that the evaluated morpho-physiological traits were useful to screen rice cultivars for salinity stress. In addition, NIAB-IRRI-9, Basmati-198 and KSK-133 can be used in breeding programs as tolerant check and Basmati-385 can be used as sensitive check.","keywords":["Rice","salinity stress","Basmati","morphological traits"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::83876c6f243491629f7281fa2bc30ef5","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Hafiz Ghulam Muhu-Din Ahmed"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::0515a80a19877a3b0c6a4ca8109718a9","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Sajid Shokat"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::7ea0d22e6dceb7458c92056b560048b3","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Adeel Khan"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::ce23a7aa92100dc9c3b906ccb09140d9","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Syed Adeel Zafar"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::c049ba6ebbf47e6dda0ba9fe6386f299","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Rana Muhammad Atif"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::1b168644135f585cf14768fe890a3760","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Muhammad Zeshan Ali"}]}

Based on the one-of relaxation technique in domain language, the algorithm is used to express the uncertain initial states and action effects in conformant planning. It converts formula one-of into a set of mutually exclusive literals with the relationship of mutual.

To analyse this is to dwell into the cohesion principle that underpins the whole European construct, going beyond the models presented by politicians – a Europe of the Regions or The United States of Europe. Our aim is to identify the disparities that might exist so far as economic and social cohesion in Romania goes. Thus, continuing a previous study concerning economic and social cohesion in Romania in the year 2010, based on a methodology developed by professor Shalom H. Schwartz from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, we set out to research the cohesion elements in the Southern and Eastern regions in our country and compare the findings of the two scientific inquiries.

Infection is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality associated with central vein catheters in patients on HD. The optimal strategy to combat TCC infec-tion is controversial. This prospective study assesses the efficacy of antibiotic-lock therapy using vancomycin and gentamycin in preventing catheter-related blood stream bacterial infection in patients on HD. A total of 86 TCC in 69 HD patients were enrolled at the time of catheter insertion for delivering HD. Patients were randomized into two groups: Group I (36 patients-39 insertions) included TCC with antibiotic-lock therapy and Group II (33 patients-47 insertions) with routine TCC management. Infection-free catheter survi-val of both groups was evaluated and compared at the end of the 18-month study period. A total of 72 TCC infections were detected with an incidence rate of 6.78 infections/1000 dialysis sessions. The rate of infection was significantly lower in Group I (4.39/1000 dialysis sessions) compared to Group II (11.69/1000 dialysis sessions), p&lt; 0.001. The bacteremia rate, as well as rate of clinical sepsis were also significantly lower in Group I than in Group II (p&lt; 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of access site infec-tion in the two groups (p> 0.05).

The progress of the humankind has been primary reflected at the level of the lexicon. After the 90’s, the Romanian vocabulary has undergone a strong influence from the English language, so thus the Romanian language is passing through a stage of modernization and internationalization.

Depending on the loaned linguistic segment, several types of calques may be distinguished: semantic calque; lexical calque; grammatical calque. The relation between the linguistic calque and the translation is highly important for the exactness of a translation from a foreign language into Romanian, “traddure, mai non tradire!”.

Norway spruce plantations located in the Foresta Demaniale Alta Val Parma (Corniglio, province of Parma - Italy) experienced since 2004 a massive outbreak of Norway spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus). This outbreak has been triggered by the exceptionally warm and dry summer of 2003. In the following years bark beetle attacks repeated and spread, raising concern about the future of this kind of stands. A survey program has been carried out to help local administration to chose the correct managements strategies. Monitoring of Ips typographus population, carried out between 2007 and 2013, confirmed the presence of two generations per year, with values above the risk threshold in 2007 and just below though very high in 2011. In the affected area, six survey plots have been realized to test different management options with the aim of favoring a fast regeneration of the forest cover. The tested options showed the great difficulty in the establishment of natural generation either for the lack of mother plants in such pure stands or for competition with tall grasses. Sowing brought no significative results, while direct plantation of indigenous broadleaves was more effective, with almost half of the individuals still alive after three years. Our results confirm the great difficulty to rebuild the forest cover after strong ecological disturbances in these artificial forests. Hybrid management strategies and ad hoc silvicultural choices seem to be the only way to manage such kind of situations in a National park, where the priority is biodiversity conservation.","keywords":["Bark Beetle","Norway Spruce","Disturbance","Natural Regeneration","Management Choices"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::1df4eb436b365f1a8d1f27f569f80601","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Barbarotti S"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::70301c46d32c43c31cf3d0862b21f36f","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Vignali G"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::f5d1e272a0d7a262b1219d5e0e7186e9","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Salvadori C"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::172c19bb7df11622434df7703ed1aaaa","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Maresi G"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::b07a9e52ca92b1030eeb734244e814bf","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Piovani P"}]}

Aims: This study aims to evaluate anxiety, depression and suicidal intent in undergraduate dental students and to find out the various areas of stress. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire (to assess academic and nonacademic areas of stress) and three scales-Hamilton scale for anxiety (HAM-A); Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) and Beck′s Suicide Intent Scale (BSI). Descriptive statistics; Pearson′s Chi-square test; Multiple ANOVA; Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the data at the significant level of P ≤ 0.05. Results: In a total of 258 dental undergraduate students, academic areas of stress that were found to be statistically significant were long teaching hours (P = 0.002); high workload (P ≤ 0.001); frequency of tests (P ≤ 0.001) and competition/fear of failure (P = 0.009). Lack of interest in the profession was a statistically significant nonacademic area for stress (P ≤ 0.001).

Potential patient benefit should be weighted against the risk and other disadvantages and/or advantages of a particular radiographic imaging technique. Measurement of dose values can act as a guidline for such risk determinations. The purpose of this study was to measure and compare the absorbed doses of various anatomic sites during these radiographic techniques. The absorbed radiation doses in bone marrow, thyroid gland, salivary gland, eye, brain and skin entrance were determined by placement of lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimetres (TLD, S) at selected anatomic sites within and on a humanlike x-ray phantom. The phantom was exposed to radiation from panoramic, linear tomographic and computer- assisted tomographic (CT) stimulated dental implant radiographic examinations. The mean dose was determined for each anatomic site. CT examination showed disruption dose, while panoramic radiography was generally the lowest.

The 288 S2 progenies from the two synthetics were evaluated using a 12 x 12 lattice design with two replications in two conditions with water stress (WS) and non water stress (NS) in Janaúba, MG, Brazil, in 2000. The combining analysis of variance showed highly significant (P<0.01) effects in environments and progenies and their interaction for Synflint, and significant ones (P<0.05) in the interaction for Syndent. The estimates of the broad sense heritability of ear yield were: Synflint h2 = 0.382 and 0.752 for WS and NS, respectively; Syndent h2 = 0.607 and 0.635 for WS and NS, respectively. The genetic variance estimates were greater in NS than in WS environments. The error variance estimates were the greatest in WS x NS interaction for the two synthetics. The predicted responses to selection pointed out better gains for yield when selection is performed in NS rather than WS environments. Substantial variability exists in these two synthetics for drought tolerance and its characteristics, indicating that there is an opportunity for improving their tolerance via recurrent selection.","keywords":["Zea mays L.","synthetic","water stress","yield","maize"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::3ef225fff387fc201cb48b6ec4949621","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"FREDERICO OZANAN MACHADO DURÃES"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::233781ab12a880017ac01d9ed9343734","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"MANOEL XAVIER DOS SANTOS"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::372a134443aca250fbbc9ebb54a486e8","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"SIDNEY NETTO PARENTONI"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::19111123455cc766608631d2a3590c16","firstname":"Elto Eugenio Gomes E.","secondnames":["Gama"],"fullname":"ELTO EUGENIO GOMES E GAMA"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::8734967cabea2705d18d4b5b8c5b19bf","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"CLESO ANTÔNIO PATTO PACHECO"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::09359477ec0c091ab38c10c767fe86fd","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"ANTÔNIO CARLOS DE OLIVEIRA"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::245d3f1ea3a085a46e9adfebf966682d","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"CARLOS EDUARDO PRADO LEITE"}]}

We synthesize recent estimates of avian mortality in Canada from a range of industrial and other human activities, to provide context for the estimates from individual sources presented in this special feature. We assessed the geographic, seasonal, and taxonomic variation in the magnitude of national-scale mortality and in population-level effects on species or groups across Canada, by combining these estimates into a stochastic model of stage-specific mortality. The range of estimates of avian mortality from each source covers several orders of magnitude, and, numerically, landbirds were the most affected group.  In total, we estimate that approximately 269 million birds and 2 million nests are destroyed annually in Canada, the equivalent of over 186 million breeding individuals. Combined, cat predation and collisions with windows, vehicles, and transmission lines caused > 95% of all mortality; the highest industrial causes of mortality were the electrical power and agriculture sectors. Other mortality sources such as fisheries bycatch can have important local or species-specific impacts, but are relatively small at a national scale. Mortality rates differed across species and families within major bird groups, highlighting that mortality is not simply proportional to abundance. We also found that mortality is not evenly spread across the country; the largest mortality sources are coincident with human population distribution, while industrial sources are concentrated in southern Ontario, Alberta, and southwestern British Columbia. Many species are therefore likely to be vulnerable to cumulative effects of multiple human-related impacts. This assessment also confirms the high uncertainty in estimating human-related avian mortality in terms of species involved, potential for population-level effects, and the cumulative effects of mortality across the landscape. Effort is still required to improve these estimates, and to guide conservation efforts to minimize direct mortality caused by human activities on Canada's wild bird populations. As avian mortality represents only a portion of the overall impact to avifauna, indirect effects such as habitat fragmentation and alteration, site avoidance, disturbance, and related issues must also be carefully considered.","keywords":["bird mortality","cats","collisions","human impacts","incidental take","industry","population effects"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::5306f5a351b475e13b93b0f62b118058","firstname":"Elizabeth A.","secondnames":["Krebs"],"fullname":"Elizabeth A.

High glucose may be a risk factor for dementia even among persons without diabetes, and in transgenic animals it has been shown to cause a potentiation of indices that are pre-symptomatic of Alzheimer′s disease. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking inflammatory events elicited in the brain during oxidative stress and diabetes, we monitored the activation of mitogen-activated kinsase (MAPKs), c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAP kinases (p38MAPK), and extracellular activating kinsae1/2 (ERK1/2) and the anti-inflammatory effects of the thioredoxin mimetic (TxM) peptides, Ac-Cys-Pro-Cys-amide (CB3) and Ac-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-amide (CB4) in the brain of male leptin-receptor-deficient Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Daily i.p. injection of CB3 to ZDF rats inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and p38MAPK, and prevented the expression of thioredoxin-interacting-protein (TXNIP/TBP-2) in ZDF rat brain. Although plasma glucose/insulin remained high, CB3 also increased the phosphorylation of AMP-ribose activating kinase (AMPK) and inhibited p70S6K kinase in the brain. Both CB3 and CB4 reversed apoptosis induced by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase as monitored by decreasing caspase 3 cleavage and PARP dissociation in SH-SY5Y cells. The decrease in JNK and p38MAPK activity in the absence of a change in plasma glucose implies a decrease in oxidative or neuroinflammatory stress in the ZDF rat brain. CB3 not only attenuated MAPK phosphorylation and activated AMPK in the brain, but it also diminished apoptotic markers, most likely acting via the MAPK–AMPK–mTOR pathway. These results were correlated with CB3 and CB4 inhibiting inflammation progression and protection from oxidative stress induced apoptosis in human neuronal cells. We suggest that by attenuating neuro-inflammatory processes in the brain Trx1 mimetic peptides could become beneficial for preventing neurological disorders associated with diabetes.\n\t\t","keywords":["Diabetes type 2","Inflammation","Thioredoxin mimetics","ZDF rat-model","MAPK","AMPK","TXNIP/TBP-2","CB3","Oxidative stress","Redox"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::da1c695d2eb9e0e2c34a636e522b0d09","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Lena Khomsky"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::4822de2dd1e94f71fa29a5094a700263","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Moshe Cohen-Kutner"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::08c4c43ab5ebff4ca854bb7b561c8191","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Daphne Atlas"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::2ac6416101a501d5ec37405d244e68d5","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Michael Trus"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::22b0e05b9ce064d6107640be3a34eeac","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Yin Liang"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::162a0676b76c1e34cdd0ca3c7044d2dc","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Hila Ben-Yehuda"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::7ccd5c92c74891358e40c1341b2824c7","firstname":"James M.","secondnames":["Lenhard"],"fullname":"Lenhard, James M."},{"id":"30|doajarticles::79a0c742dc8a299754594b2864e95c67","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Tonya Martin"}]}

Pneumococcal growth is a prerequisite for its virulence and requires an appropriate supply of cellular energy. Adenylate kinases constitute a major family of enzymes that regulate cellular ATP levels. Some bacterial adenylate kinases (AdKs) are known to be critical for growth, but the physiological effects of AdKs in pneumococci have been poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, by crystallographic and functional studies, we report that the catalytic activity of adenylate kinase from S. pneumoniae (SpAdK) serotype 2 D39 is essential for growth. We determined the crystal structure of SpAdK in two conformations: ligand-free open form and closed in complex with a two-substrate mimic inhibitor adenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A). Crystallographic analysis of SpAdK reveals Arg-89 as a key active site residue. We generated a conditional expression mutant of pneumococcus in which the expression of the adk gene is tightly regulated by fucose. The expression level of adk correlates with growth rate. Expression of the wild-type adk gene in fucose-inducible strains rescued a growth defect, but expression of the Arg-89 mutation did not. SpAdK increased total cellular ATP levels. Furthermore, lack of functional SpAdK caused a growth defect in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SpAdK is essential for pneumococcal growth in vitro and in vivo.","keywords":["Streptococcus pneumoniae","Adenylate kinase","Crystal structure","Bacteria growth","Virulence factor"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::be9355c2226ee6fca76f348b7ce09b39","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Truc Thanh Luong"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::8b0696e0dc71b56b1c7f5aae9b071c12","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Dong-Kwon Rhee"},{"id":"30|doajarticles::25ad0656c87e17b36a13fcf7bd2017ba","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Trung Thanh Thach"},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::310df993a8c4090d35f2a7504628e550","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Sangho Lee"}]}

Fibres are expensive due to limited feedstock and less fibre production. To keep up with the demand these fibres are adulterated with less expensive fibres viz., wool to give special effect to the fabric. To control false declaration, there is a need for fibre identification and to ascertain blend composition. Though Scanning Electron Microscopy is generally used for fibre analysis but this method is time consuming, expensive and the reliability of results depend on the expertise of the microscopist. Hence, there is a need for reliable and economical method to characterize these fibres and to study composition of each animal fibre in blends. The aim of the present study was mitochondrial DNA extraction from animal natural fibres in untreated and blends. The modified protocol includes addition of Proteinase K, Dithioerythritol individually in each tube and final extraction with phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol, amplification of D-loop region using species specific and mammalian specific primers. We observed that with species specific primers, it was possible to study inter species variation but the blends could be detected if there was prior knowledge about the fibres in blends. With mammalian specific primers we could study blends and differentiate between fibres from sheep breeds but inter species variation was difficult. It can be concluded that mtDNA analysis can be used to differentiate animal fibres and control adulteration.","keywords":["displacement-loop","mitochondrial DNA","adulteration and false declaration","Speciality fibres","species and mammalian specific primers"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::562d54d82dacd4ab330af3263b401e34","firstname":"Priyanka P.","secondnames":["Rane"],"fullname":"Priyanka P.

In the case of Ireland the Cervantine inspiration, albeit minor and neglected, has also been present; and, it is most probably the nineteenth century which provides the most ample and varied response to Cervantes’s masterpiece in many a different way. Our aim is to see briefly how the legacy of Don Quixote found distinct expression on the Emerald Isle. Indeed, all these Cervantine contributions from Ireland during the nineteenth century were also deeply imbued with the politics of literature and society in a country which experienced historical, social and cultural turmoil. The reference to Cervantes as a key writer in Spanish letters will not only be reduced to his masterpiece of all times; but, will also be tackled in critical pieces of importance in Ireland.","keywords":["Don Quixote","Cervantes","The Dublin University Magazine","Chenevix","Maxwell","Wellington","Anglo-Irish"],"authors":[{"id":"30|doajarticles::8280cb1c7578bdbb8a4fa0e610b9f1f5","firstname":null,"secondnames":null,"fullname":"Asier Altuna-García de Salazar"}]}

The action develops gradually, slowly, which is emphasized, in addition to verbal periphrasis, with adverbials of time or manner. Venir + gerund indicates continuous, progressive action, which develops from a certain point of time-spatial area where the speaker is located. The direction of movement is therefore different from that indicated by the ir + gerund resulting from the point where there is a speaker, and is directed forward.

Metaphor translation poses the problems of switching between different cultural references, as well as conceptual and linguistic perspectives. Dealing with metaphors in translation, thus, is not simply a matter of identifying the linguistic correspondences in two languages under study, but of identifying correspondences between their conceptual systems corresponding to their different cultural models. The main purpose of this paper is to present the findings of a study that investigated emotive metaphoric conceptualizations and their dominant patterns in Persian and English. The emotions under study are metaphorical expressions of happiness and sadness which have been compiled from a literary source text and its two corresponding target texts. The Metaphor Identification Procedures (MIP), proposed by the Pragglejazz group (2007), and Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) were adopted as the framework for analysis.

When the piezocomposite transducer is used for ultrasonic emission in air, it is necessary the use of high amplitude pulses to generate high acoustic signal. So, the nonlinear behavior must to be in account and the nonlinear measurements have been carried out with burst excitation in similar application conditions. The new proposed method measure current, as well as vibration velocity, of the piezocomposite transducer for burst signal excitation, near the thickness resonance frequency. The current of the stationary response is measured before the end of the burst, for different piezocomposite. Burst excitation enables us to measure the nonlinear behavior to avoid overheating the transducers, when high signals are used. Three piezocomposites nonlinear measurement methods are compared with an increase of the accuracy. The current and velocity dependence of a point of transducer versus the excitation of the amplitude level is analyzed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;En Ensayos No Destructivos, así como en la emisión de ultrasonidos, se utilizan frecuentemente transductores resonantes realizados con piezocomposites 1-3. Cuando el transductor piezocomposite se emplea emitiendo ultrasonidos en aire, es necesario el uso de pulsos de gran amplitud para generar una señal acústica elevada y tener en cuenta el régimen no lineal. Las medidas de caracterización no lineal se han llevado a cabo con excitación a ráfagas en condiciones próximas a las de las aplicaciones. Se propone un nuevo método que mide la corriente y la velocidad de vibración del transductor piezocomposite con una señal de excitación a ráfagas para frecuencias cercanas a la de resonancia grosor. La corriente de la respuesta estacionaria del transductor se mide justo antes del final de la ráfaga para diferentes composites. El uso de estas excitaciones nos permite medir el comportamiento no lineal de piezocomposites evitando el sobrecalentamiento de los transductores al utilizar alta señal. Se comparan tres métodos de medidas no lineales en piezocomposites donde la precisión de los resultados se incrementa en cada uno de ellos. Se analiza la respuesta de la corriente y de la velocidad de un punto del transductor en función de la amplitud de la excitación.","keywords":["Composites","Non linearity","Transducers","Burst","NDT","No linealidad","Transductores","Ráfagas","END"],"authors":[{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::727463ec506cf98ed93a273531da1321","firstname":"A.","secondnames":["Albareda"],"fullname":"Albareda, A."},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::0093fc2d0016b4e8b74663c193c3b5b6","firstname":"F.","secondnames":["Montero Espinosa"],"fullname":"Montero de Espinosa, F."},{"id":"30|dedup_wf_001::0a249d91b8878423107e4c13b5ac8a7c","firstname":"R.","secondnames":["Pérez"],"fullname":"R.
