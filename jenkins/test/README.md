The `Jenkinsfile` within this directory is used to create Jenkins job that will be responsible for building IIS, running unit tests and pushing the build status to IIS GitHub repo. 

The detailed description of how to create the job is on IIS repo wiki page [Jenkins and GitHub integration](https://github.com/openaire/iis/wiki/Jenkins-and-GitHub-integration).
