Thirty-seven clones were selected, and their transcriptional start-sites were determined. The upstream sequence of these 37 start-sites, and the sequences of seven previously identified promoters were compared. On the basis of sequence conservation and mutational analysis, a consensus sequence CTTGACN 16\u201323 TATNNT was obtained. In this consensus sequence, nine on of twelve bases are identical to the canonical Escherichia coli σ 70 promoter, however the R.etli promoters only contain 6.4 conserved bases on average. We show that the R.etli sigma factor SigA recognizes all R.etli promoters studied in this work, and that E.coli RpoD is incapable of recognizing them. The comparison of the predicted structure of SigA with the known structure of RpoD indicated that regions 2.4 and 4.2, responsible for promoter recognition, are different only by a single amino acid, whereas the region 1 of SigA contains 72 extra residues, suggesting that the differences contained in this region could be related to the lax promoter recognition of SigA.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme consists of a core enzyme (α 2 ββ\u2032), and one sigma factor (σ) subunit, which directs the core enzyme to specific sites on DNA to initiate transcription. In general, bacteria contain a main or housekeeping sigma factor, also known as sigma-70 (σ 70 ) which controls the expression of most of the genes, in association with the RNApol core ( 1 \u2013 4 ). Sequence alignments of several σ 70 factors from different bacteria reveal four conserved regions (1 to 4), that have been further divided into subregions, involved in different aspects of transcription initiation, including promoter recognition, promoter melting, initiaton of RNA syntesis, abortive initiation and promoter escape ( 5 ).\nThe σ 70 subunit of E.coli and Bacillus subtilis recognizes two types of promoter sequences: the first one, or \u2018canonical promoter\u2019, consisting of two hexamer sequences [TTGACA] and [TATAAT], centered respectively in the positions −10 and −35 relative to the transcription start-site ( 6 , 7 ). A helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motif located in the C-terminus of σ 70 (subregion 4.2) recognizes the −35 box of the promoter, whereas a more centrally located α-helix (subregion 2.4) recognizes the −10 box ( 8 ). The second one, named \u2018extended−10 promoter\u2019 consists of an element [TATAAT] plus 2 nt [TG], located in the −15 and −14 positions. In this promoter type a −35 region or equivalent sequence does not exist. The N-terminal part of the subregion 3.0 (previously named 2.5) from σ 70 is involved in the recognition of the conserved [TG] motif ( 9 \u2013 11 ).\nRhizobium etli is a soil α-proteobacterium with the ability to colonize the roots of bean-plants to form nitrogen fixing nodules. The whole genomic sequence of R.etli CFN42 was recently concluded [( 12 ); GeneBank accession no CP000133], and consists of a circular chromosome and six large plasmids, with an average G + C content of 61.5%. R.etli contains a large number of sigma factors (one housekeeping σ 70 gene, two copies of rpoH , two copies of rpoN and 18 genes of the extracitoplasmic factor group), a feature shared with other nitrogen fixing organisms, like Bradyrhizobium japonicum , Mesorhizobium loti and Sinorhizobium meliloti ( 4 ). The physiological roles and the mechanisms of promoter recognition by these sigma factors remain unknown. Moreover, in these organisms only a few well-characterized promoters are available.\nThe R.etli housekeeping σ 70 gene ( sigA ) encodes a protein of 685 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 77.18 kDa. The primary structure of SigA is very similar to RpoD (the σ 70 factor of E.coli ), especially in regions 2, 3 and 4, however SigA contains an extended region 1 ( 13 ).\nS.meliloti , Caulobacter crescentus and Rhodobacter sphaeroide s also have a larger SigA region 1, and most of their σ 70 promoters that have been characterized are not transcribed by the E . coli RNApol in vivo or in vitro , but in contrast, the RNApol of these bacteria can initiate transcription of typical E . coli σ 70 promoters ( 13 \u2013 16 ). This observation suggests some differences between the transcriptional machineries of E.coli and the α-proteobacteria, perhaps at the level of promoter recognition by the σ 70 factor.\nThe knowledge of the promoter structures and their regulation in a particular organism is the first step towards the molecular understanding of the regulatory networks, an essential prerequisite to develop tools for genetic engineering.\nTo analyze the molecular basis of R.etli gene expression in this study, we identified, characterized and sequenced active promoters in R.etli under exponential growth conditions. A consensus promoter sequence was deduced, and possesses some differences to the promoter consensus recognized by σ 70 in E.coli and B.subtilis . We showed that the double helix stability and the stacking energy of the R.etli and E.coli promoter regions possess a minimal energy value around −10 box, suggesting that despite the differences in their promoter structures, the promoters of both bacteria preserve thermodynamic properties, which favor DNA denaturation and help the transcription initiation. We demonstrated that SigA specifically recognizes the R.etli promoters studied in this work, but in contrast, the E.coli RNApol holoenzyme is incapable of recognizing them. Finally, we propose that R.etli contains a less strict σ 70 that recognizes a lax consensus promoter structure.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and growth conditions\nThe bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1 . E.coli strains were grown at 37°C in Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium. R.etli strains were grown at 30°C in PY medium ( 17 ) or minimal medium containing 1.2 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 0.8 mM MgSO 4 , 10 mM succinic acid, 10 mM NH 4 Cl, 1.5 mM CaCl 2 and 0.0005% FeCl 3 , with the pH adjusted to 6.8 ( 18 ). Microaerobic conditions during growth were set up by putting the cultures in 150 ml bottles that were flushed with several volumes of a 1% oxygen-99% argon mixture and closed with an airtight stopper. Antibiotics were added at the following final concentrations (in µgml −1 ): gentamicin 30; chloramphenicol 25; ampicillin 100; nalidixic acid 20. When it was used, X-Gluc (5-Br-4-Cl-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronic acid, Research Organics) was added at a final concentration of 20 µgml −1 .\nDNA and RNA isolation and manipulation\nGenomic DNA was isolated using components and instructions from GenomicPrep cells and tissue DNA isolation kit (Amersham). Plasmid DNA was isolated as described by Sambrook et al . ( 19 ). DNA was restricted and ligated under the conditions specified by the enzyme manufacturer (Invitrogen). Taq DNA polymerase (Altaenzymes) was used for PCR. The PCR products were cloned using a pMOSblue blunt-ended kit (Amersham). RNA was isolated using components and instructions from the High pure RNA isolation kit (Roche).\nConstruction of a R.etli promoter library\nTo isolate DNA fragments containing promoters, 10 mg chromosomal DNA of CFN42 strain was disrupted by nebulization during 2 min to 10 psi. Fragments ranging from 0.5 to 1 kb were purified from an agarose gel, blunted with Klenow and T4 pol enzymes, and ligated into the alkaline phosphatase treated Sma I sites of the promoter-trap vector pBBMCS53, which contains a promoterless gusA gene ( 20 ). The ligation mixture was electropored into DH10B using the instructions from ElectroMAX DH10B cell kit (GibcoBRL). Single colonies were selected in LB plates containing gentamicin.\nBacterial matings\npBBMCS53 derivatives were introduced by conjugation into R.etli CFN42 using pRK2013 as a helper plasmid. Strains were grown in PY liquid medium to a stationary phase, mixed in a proportion of donor\u2013helper\u2013receptor of 1:1:2 on PY plates and incubated at 30°C overnight. Cells were resuspended in fresh PY medium, and serial dilutions were plated in PY nalidixic acid 20, gentamicin 30 and X-Gluc. Clones containing fragments with a promoter were selected by blue\/white screening of transconjugants.\nβ-Glucuronidase activity measurements\nOvernight cultures of the strains carrying the desired constructs were grown in the presence of the appropriate selection. Cultures were diluted in fresh PY medium to an OD 540 of 0.01 and grown to a final OD 540 of 0.4. The culture (1 ml) was centrifuged and resuspended in a salt wash solution supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 mgml −1 ). Quantitative β-glucuronidase assays were performed with p -nitrophenyl glucuronide substrate as described previously ( 21 ). Data were normalized to total-cell protein concentration by the Lowry method ( 19 ). The results presented in the figures are the mean of three independent experiments.\nTranscription start-sites determination\nTranscription start-sites were mapped by means of 5\u2032 RACE kit version 2.0 (Invitrogen). Briefly, DNA single chains (scDNA) were synthesized from 5 to 10 mg of total RNA using a gene-specific primer (GUS-LW5, CGATCCAGACTGAATGCCCAC) complementary to the region located in the position 96 to117 from gusA , and using a derivative of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MLV RT). After first strand cDNA synthesis, the original mRNA template was removed by treatment with a RNase Mix (mixture of RNase H and RNase T1) and the scDNA was purified using a GlassMax DNA column. A homopolymeric tail was then added to the 3\u2032 end of the scDNA using Terminal deoxynucleotidil transferase (TdT) and dCTP. In the next step, a PCR amplification was accomplished using Taq DNA polymerase, a second antisense primer (GUS-LW4, GTAACATAAGGGACTGACCTGC) that was complementary to gusA in the position 28 to 49, and a complementary homopolymer tail primer (AAP, GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG). When secondary bands were obtained, an additional PCR was done using an AAP primer and a third antisense primer (GUS-LW2, GCTTGGCGTAATCATGGTCAT), that was complementary to the DNA region located in the position 1 to 21 from gusA .\nDNA sequencing\nDNA sequencing reactions were performed using the GUS-LW primers and Big-Dye terminator kit version 3.1 in an automatic 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).\nConstruction of promoter mutations\nMutant versions of the p hemC and lac promoters were constructed by PCR using oligonucleotides carrying altered versions of the wild-type −35, −10 and both boxes simultaneously. Each PCR product was cloned in to pBBMCS53 vector and introduced into R.etli CFN42 by triparental conjugation.\nOverexpression and purification of the R.etli SigA protein\nA DNA fragment corresponding to the full-length sigA gene of R.etli was PCR amplified from total DNA, and cloned into pET-28a(+) (Novagen) to express sigA in BL21 (DE3)plysS strain ( 22 ). The induction in exponential growth phase (OD 540 = 0.4) was obtained by the addition of isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) up to the final concentration 1 mM. Cells were harvested after 4 h of cultivation and stored at −70°C. A total of 10 ml of culture usually yielded 2.5\u20133 mg of protein. Histidine tagged sigma protein was purified using HisTrap Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer, containing 8 M urea and 0.25 mM phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) [1× phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 20 mM imidazole], and incubated 30 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. After sedimentation of cell debris, lyzate was loaded on to Ni-column and equilibrated with a binding buffer. The desired protein was eluted by phosphate buffer, containing 400 mM imidazol, collected in 0.5 ml fractions, and analyzed in 10% SDS\u2013PAGE. The applied procedure provides protein of 95% purity. To avoid the influence of six-aminoacide histidine tagg, HisTrap purified protein was treated by thrombin (Thrombin CleanCleave Kit, Sigma) after buffer exchange by dialysis. After the thrombin treatment protein was dialyzed against TGED buffer [10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.6); 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM DTT; 0.1 M NaCl; 5% (v\/v) glycerol] and storage buffer [10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.6); 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM DTT; 10 mM MgCl 2 ; 0.2 M KCl; 50% (v\/v) glycerol]. The final concentration of protein was evaluated by method of Bradford (Bio-Rad protein assay kit).\nDNA binding shift assay\nLinear DNA templates were randomly labeled with [α-P 32 ]dCTP in a standard PCR, purified from 3.5% PAGE and used for DNA\u2013protein complex formation. RNA polymerase was assembled from core and σ 70 protein as it was described by Tang et al . ( 23 ). Binary complexes were allowed to preform for 20 min at 30°C, challenged by heparin (200 mg\/ml) and immediately loaded on to 3.5% native PAGE, prewarmed up to the same temperature. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and radioautographed.\nSoftware tools\nMultiple DNA alignments were done using the programs CLUSTALW version 1.8.1 ( 24 ) and MultiAlin version 5.4.1 ( 25 ). Alignments were visually inspected and adapted with respect to the known transcriptional start-sites. Consensus matrices were generated and selected using WCONSENSUS version v5c ( 26 ). Briefly, to identify the −10 box, the first 20 bp upstream from the transcription start-site (+1) were used. To identify the −35 box, the 20 bp upstream to the −20 position were used as an input for WCONSENSUS. Algorithms available from server ( 27 ) were used to evaluate double helix stability ( 28 ) and stacking energy ( 29 ). Calculations for each parameter were carried out with a window size of 10 and 20 nt, providing similar results. For each promoter position, the average value was calculated for the whole set of analyzed sequences.\nRESULTS\nIsolation of R.etli promoter sequences\nTo determine the general structure of the R.etli promoters, a random genomic library with an average insert size of 0.5 kb was constructed in the promoter-test vector pBBMCS53 and introduced by conjugation into R.etli CFN42. Direct screening on PY plates containing X-Gluc allowed the selection of transconjugants with an active reporter gene ( gusA ), suggesting that the constructs contained R.etli promoter regions. The β-glucuronidase activity of 100 transconjugans was determined in PY liquid cultures in exponential and stationary phases of growth. Sixty-eight of these clones showed β-glucuronidase activity under both conditions, while the remaining 32 transconjugants expressed the reporter gene only in PY plates, and for this reason were not used in further experiments. The ability to express the reporter gene of the 68 strains described above was tested in different conditions: low oxygen (1%), minimal medium (MM) and at different temperatures (30, 42 or −10°C). All but three expressed the reporter gene in all conditions, but at different levels, suggesting that the transconjugants carry constructs with constitutive promoters. The DNA sequences of 36 inserts of these constructs were determined. These promoter sequences, plus seven R.etli promoters experimentally identified in other studies were selected for subsequent analyses ( 30 \u2013 35 ).\nThirty-three promoters were mapped within intergenic regions; eight within the coding regions of the immediately preceeding gene, and three in DNA sections that contained overlapped coding regions.\nThe genetic compartments of the 44 promoters of our collection were next: thirty-nine were located on the chromosome, two on plasmid p42d and one in each of these plasmids: p42b, p42e and p42f.\nIdentification of transcriptional start-sites\nThe transcription start-sites are good reference points to identify the upstream conserved sequence characteristics of the promoters. Thus, the 5\u2032 ends of the mRNAs synthesized from each of the selected 36 promoter regions selected, were successfully identified by 5\u2032 RACE using the total RNA isolated from PY cultures in exponential growth conditions of the transconjugants. In general, a single RT\u2013PCR product was obtained, but in one clone, two conspicuous amplification products were observed. In this case the bands were independently isolated, cloned and sequenced, showing that these products are transcripts associated to the same gene.\nThirty-eight of the transcription start-sites (86%) fell within the first 250 bp upstream from coding regions, and four transcription start-sites corresponded to the nucleotide A of the start codon ATG from their respective ORF ( Table 2 ).\nDetermination of a promoter consensus sequence\nThe promoter consensus sequence was derived by aligning 50 bp upstream from the transcription start-site of each promoter region. The identification of −10 and −35 boxes was corroborated with the WCONSENSUS program as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 1a , over-represented nucleotides clearly appeared around the −35 region and, in a lesser degree, in the −10 region. Then, the putative −10 consensus box [TATNNT] showed four identical positions to the −10 box of the E.coli consensus promoter [ TAT AA T ] recognized by σ 70 factor. The 3\u2032 end of the R.etli −10 consensus boxes was positioned from 3 to 10 bp upstream from the transcriptional start-site ( Figure 1c ). Six promoter regions (14%) showed the dinucleotide [TG] in positions −15 and −14, which resembled the structure of the E.coli −10 extended promoter. The −35 box consensus sequence [CTTGAC], is identical in five positions to the equivalent box of the E.coli consensus promoter [ TTGAC A] recognized by σ 70 . The spacing between the −35 and −10 regions ranges from 16 to 23 bp ( Figure 1b ). The promoter sequences contain 6.4 conserved bases on average, of the 12 conforming −10 and −35.\nSuboptimal promoters were identified in 11 of the 44 promoter regions as shown in Figure 1a , but they were not taken in account to generate the consensus promoter sequence for the following reasons: none of them contained both hexameric boxes recognized by the best statistic parameters of WCONSENSUS. Nevertheless, in six of these promoters the −35 box overlapped with one proposed by us. In one case the −10 box overlapped the region proposed here. Moreover, some of the suboptimal promoters contained the spacer region two long (up to 27 bp) or to short (11 or 12 bp). In two cases the transcription start-sites were located far of the −10 boxes (up to 20 bp).\nThe results presented here showed that the R.etli promoter consensus possesses some similarities with the E.coli promoter consensus recognized by the σ 70 factor, but the variability in the nucleotide frequency in each position of the consensus was greater than that observed in E.coli promoters ( 7 ).\nThermodynamic properties of the R.etli promoter regions\nIt was recently demonstrated in several bacteria genomes, that the intergenic regions containing promoters are generally less stable and less flexible than coding regions ( 36 ). To determine if these thermodynamic properties are also present in the promoter regions of R.etli , the stacking energy and the double helix stability were evaluated in our collection of 44 promoters. For this analysis the sequence of 200 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream from transcription start-site of all members of the promoter collection were taken in account. As an internal control, a set similar in size and length was constructed with the immediately downstream coding region of each member of the promoter collection. The same properties were predicted and contrasted with two E.coli equivalent sets: one containing 44 randomly chosen promoter sequences experimentally characterized and putatively recognized by σ 70 , and the other of 44 coding region sequences that corresponded to the genes controlled by the selected promoters. As shown in Figure 2a , the distribution profiles of double helix stability for coding and no coding regions of R.etli were similar, however, a significative local minimum around the −10 element was detected in our collection of promoter regions. The average stability of the E.coli coding regions was higher than the average stability of their promoter regions, and like R.etli , a prominent feature of the promoter regions was a minimum stability around the −10 box ( Figure 2b ).\nThe stacking energy profiles of R.etli and E.coli promoter regions were variable, but with a tendency to low negative values (low stability), nevertheless local minimum values were located around the −10 box. In contrast, the stacking energy profiles of R.etli and E.coli coding regions were similar: both showed more negative values that corresponded to great stability ( Figure 2a and b). These results suggest that despite the variability in the nucleotide composition of R.etli promoters, these regions possess thermodynamic and structural properties similar to the E.coli promoter regions.\nPromoter sequence mutagenesis\nTo demonstrate that the promoter consensus proposed here is correct, the DNA sequence of three R.etli mutant promoters (from repA , the antisense RNA gene present in the p42d repABC operon and recA ) with the reduced transcriptional activity previously characterized was located in our alignment. As shown in Figure 3 , these mutations fall in the regions centred in −10 and −35 of the consensus, suggesting that these elements were correctly identified.\nAdditionally the promoter consensus was verified in the following way: the constitutive promoter (p hemC ) of hemC , a gene encoding a porphobilinogen deaminase protein, was selected for a mutagenic analysis. This promoter possessed five conserved positions from consensus and showed moderate activity. Three mutant derivatives were constructed that deviated the promoter sequence from the consensus. First, the putative −35 element was altered, changing sequence [ATTGCG] to [A AGA CG] to generate the construct pGUSp hemC -35. Second, the putative −10 element was changed from [TACGAG] to [ GCG GAG] to produce construct pGUSp hemC -10. Third, the putative wild-type −35 and −10 elements were changed at the same time to the sequences indicated before, to generate plasmid pGUSp hemC -1035. These constructs were introduced into R.etli CFN42, and the β-glucuronidase activities of the transconjugants were determined. As shown in Figure 3 , all mutant constructs showed a low level of β-glucuronidase activity, indicating that the −35 and −10 elements of the R.etli promoter consensus were correctly identified.\nActivity of the R.etli promoters in E.coli\nAs described in the previous section, the R.etli σ 70 promoter consensus sequence is more variable than that described for E.coli . This observation suggests that the E.coli σ 70 is unable to recognize the R.etli promoters or recognizes them less efficiently. To prove this possibility, the 36 transcriptional fusions of the collection were introduced into the BW21038 ( gusA ) strain, and their β-glucuronidase activities were evaluated in plates supplemented with X-Gluc. In this experiment only three promoters were functional, but showed low β-glucuronidase activity. These results suggest that the 33 transcriptional fusions are poorly or unrecognized by the E.coli sigma factors. It is possible than the E.coli σ 70 is incapable of binding the R.etli promoters because it is more stringent in its recognition pattern, and imposes a strict functional barrier. If this hypothesis is true, then the R.etli σ 70 (SigA) activates the transcriptional fusions described above in E.coli . To demonstrate this, all strains containing the gusA fusions were transformed with a plasmid expressing the R.etli σ 70 gene under the control of the lac promoter and the β-glucuronidase activity of the transformants were evaluated in LB plates containing X-Gluc. Representative results are shown in Figure 4 . The expression of sigA allowed the gusA fusions to express their reporter gene in the 36 R.etli promoter regions studied here, however, the strains containing sigA constructs were unstable, and a mixure of blue and white colonies was observed in the plates ( Figure 4 ). The results suggest that R.etli σ 70 is responsible for the transcriptional activity of these promoters, and that the structural variability of R.etli promoters cannot be recognized by E.coli σ 70 .\nThe E.coli σ 70 is incapable of binding in vitro R.etli promoters\nTo verify if the R.etli promoters are recognized by the E.coli σ 70 factor, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments were done using E.coli RNApol containing E.coli σ 70 and a PCR product containing the promoter of hemC gene (p hemC ), plus the PCR products of four promoter regions selected at random: ureA , cycH , yhch00197 and yhch00468 . As a negative control, a PCR product of a mutant derivative of promoter p hemC containing the changes in the −10 and −35 elements described previously was used, and as a positive control, a PCR product containing the lac promoter was used ( lac promoter is functional in R.etli ). Representative results are shown in Figure 5a . In all experiments the E.coli RNApol holoenzyme was unable to bind the R.etli promoters tested, indicating that E.coli σ 70 cannot recognize R.etli promoters.\nSigA binds in vitro R.etli promoters\nTo determine if SigA is capable of recognizing the R.etli promoters, binding shift experiments were done using a chimeric RNApol holoenzyme composed of E.coli RNApol core and R.etli σ 70 factor assembled in vitro . As a target DNA, the PCR products containing the promoters mentioned above (p hemC and the promoters of ureA , cycH , yhch00197 and yhch00468 genes) were used in these experiments. Representative results are shown in Figure 5 . The chimeric RNApol holoenzyme bound the five PCR products, but at low efficiency ( Figure 5b ). In contrast, no DNA binding shifts were observed using a PCR control with the mutant promoter p hemC ( Figure 5c ). These results showed that the chimeric RNApol holoenzyme specifically recognizes the R.etli promoters.\nComparative analysis of the σ 70 consensus sequences from different bacteria\nThe R.etli σ 70 promoter consensus was compared with those of the: (i) α-proteobacteria C.crescentus (G + C% of 67) ( 37 ) and Rhodobacter capsulatus (G + C% of 67) ( 38 ); (ii) the γ-proteobacteria E.coli (G + C% of 52) ( 6 ); and (iii) B.subtilis (G + C% of 43) ( 39 ). In the promoter consensus sequences of C.crescentus , R.capsulatus and R.etli , the −35 boxes are more conserved than the −10 boxes ( Figure 6 ). Furthermore, the inspection of the all sequences showed that each bacterial species has a consensus sequence, with a different degree of variability. The R.etli and R.capsulatus promoters contain 6.4 and 5.0 conserved bases on average, respectively, less conserved in comparison with the promoter consensus of C.crescentus , that contains 8.0, E.coli 7.9 and B.subtilis 9.1 conserved nucleotides ( 7 , 39 , 40 ). Finally, the number of conserved nucleotides, especially in the −10 box, tends to diminish when genomic G + C content is above 60%. It is worth noting that the E.coli and B.subtilis −10 and −35 boxes are A + T rich and conserve 10 of 12 positions.\nDISCUSSION\nR.etli is a bacterium that inhabits diverse environments and has genome rich in genes related to transcriptional regulation, suggesting that it contains a complex genetic regulation system. To characterize the molecular basis of the transcription, and particulary, what kind of sequences act as promoters in R.etli , we identified and characterized a promoter consensus sequence recognized by the R.etli σ 70 factor (SigA) in this paper.\nThe R.etli σ 70 promoter consensus sequence [CTTGAC] N 16\u201323 [TATNNT] was deduced from 44 promoter regions. Using site-directed mutagenesis of one representative R.etli promoter isolated in this work, and a collection of mutants of three promoter regions described previously, we found that all changes fell within the −10 or −35 boxes identified in this work, suggesting that the consensus sequence is correct. Moreover, two different lines of evidence indicate that this promoter consensus sequence is recognized by the R.etli σ 70 . The first one is that gusA fusions containing R.etli promoters are not functional in E.coli , but all regain their activity when complemented with SigA. Second, SigA is able to bind to the R.etli promoters but not to their mutant derivatives that partially eliminate the −35 or −10 boxes.\nThe location of the 44 promoter regions in the R.etli genome showed that 33 are located within intergenic regions, and that 8 (18%), fall within coding regions. This situation has also been observed in other bacteria, i.e. in E.coli 18% of the promoters are within genes ( 41 ), and around of 20% in Prochlorococcus marinus ( 42 ).\nOf the promoters 86% analyzed here were located less than 250 bp from the translation start codons of their genes. This property has been widely studied in E.coli , where it is known that 90% of the promoters are located less than 250 bp upstream from the gene that they regulate ( 41 ).\nAlthough the R.etli , B.subtilis and E.coli promoter consensus display a common structure, the R.etli consensus sequence contains only 6.4 conserved bases on average, revealing a more variable composition than in the E.coli and B.subtilis consensus, where 7.9 and 9.1 nt are conserved on average, respectively ( 7 , 39 , 40 ). Additionally, the R.etli promoter consensus shows that the sequence length between the −10 and −35 boxes varies from 16 to 23 nt, nevertheless, 25 of the promoters (56.81%) present a distance of 17 ± 1 nt. This variation range is similar to that found in E.coli (15 to 21 nt) and in B.subtilis (14 to 20 nt). The percentage of promoters with 17 ± 1 nt in length between the hexameric boxes, is quite low compared to E.coli (92%) and B.subtilis (84.5%) ( 6 , 39 ). The distance between +1 nt and −10 box 3\u2032 end fluctuates from 3 to 10 bases, as found in E.coli and B.subtilis ( 6 , 39 ). Six promoters (14%) were found with a putative −10 extended sequence, and their frequency is lower than those reported for this kind of promoter in E.coli (20%) and B.subtilis (45%) ( 39 , 43 , 44 ).\nA computer analysis of DNA double helix stability and stacking energy showed that the promoter regions presented a minimum value for both parameters around −10 box, as found in E.coli promoters. Having these results in mind, it is reasonable to conclude that in spite of their sequence heterogeneity, the promoter regions preserve thermodynamic properties which have been selected to favor DNA denaturation and help to start the transcription. Similar conclusions have been drawn for other bacterial promoter regions ( 36 , 45 ).\nThe R.etli promoters tested are not recognized by E.coli σ 70 , however, the E.coli lac promoter is recognized by R.etli σ 70 , suggesting that R.etli σ 70 is more promiscuous than E.coli σ 70 .\nThe deduced primary structure of SigA is 47% similar to the E coli σ 70 , especially in regions 2.4 and 4.2, which are responsible for promoter recognition. The most notable difference between SigA and RpoD is the larger size of region 1 of SigA, which contains 72 extra amino acids. This region could be related to the lax promoter recognition of SigA. Thus, E. coli σ 70 being the strictest factor for promoter recognition, it allows less structural variation, which is reflected in a robust consensus sequence. The opposite case is observed in α-proteobacteria, where the promiscuous σ 70 allows a larger variation in its promoter structure.\nA promiscuous σ 70 factor could be an adaptive advantage for bacteria like the α-proteobacteria that inhabit environments with high biological and enviromental diversity, because they can take the benefits of the genetic information acquired by horizontal transfer in a fast and efficient way, avoiding a barrier that could limit the acquisition of new functions required for the adaptation to new environmental conditions.\nOur comparison of the □□□□□□□□ consensus of several bacteria suggests that differences in the genomic G + C content are related to promoter structure: the bacteria with high G + C content tend to be more variable, and to have −10 boxes different in sequence to those from bacteria with low G + C content, and vice versa. Previous evidence in other organisms supports this conclusion ( 46 ).\nReferences\nThe authors wish to thank Marco Zúñiga, Rosa Elena Gómez Barreto, Ismael Hernández, Patricia Bustos, Rosa Isela Santamaría and José Espíritu for their skillful technical support.

Recent progress in this direction created various field-portable and cost-effective designs that have the capacity to perform e.g., flow-cytometry [11] , optical coherence tomography [12] , [13] , water quality monitoring [14] , fluorescent imaging [15] \u2013 [17] , and other imaging\/sensing tasks [18] , [19] even in resource limited settings.\nLensfree holographic on-chip microscopes form an emerging sub-group of such POC imaging devices, and of digital holography in general [20] \u2013 [31] , offering competitive alternatives to conventional lens-based microscopes, with several key advantages such as wide field-of-view (FOV) and large depth-of-field, yielding giga-pixel range phase and amplitude images, in addition to compactness and cost-effectiveness, making them especially appealing for global health related applications [32] \u2013 [35] .\nThese computational microscopes do not use any lenses between the object and the image sensor chip, where the object is placed in close proximity (∼ 0.1\u20131 mm) to the active area of the sensor chip. A partially coherent light source, e.g., a light emitting diode (LED) is positioned a few centimetres (∼ 5\u20137 cm) away from the object plane, and the transmitted light pattern through the object is sampled by the sensor chip [32] , [36] . Consequently, in this on-chip imaging geometry rather than directly acquiring an image of the object, the diffracted light that is transmitted through the specimen interferes with the unperturbed light from the illumination source, forming an in-line hologram on the image sensor plane. As a result of its unit magnification, the imaging FOV is equivalent to the active area of the image sensor chip, which can be as large as e.g., 20\u201330 mm 2 for a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor chip or >10 cm 2 for a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD). Accordingly, the FOV of lensfree on-chip microscopy is significantly wider than the FOV of a lens-based transmission microscope that has a similar resolution level [32] , [37] . An additional advantage of these holographic on-chip microscopes is that the recorded image can be digitally focused to different depths, thus allowing screening of large sample volumes [38] \u2013 [40] .\nOn the other hand, spatial resolution of such lensfree on-chip microscopes is limited by the pixel size of the image sensor chip. To digitally circumvent this limitation, and hence improve the spatial resolution of these computational microscopes, pixel-super resolution techniques can be utilized by source shifting, which creates sub-pixel shifted replicas of the same object hologram on the sensor-array. This pixel super-resolution approach enables us to reduce the effective pixel-size of the image sensor to digitally enhance the numerical aperture (NA) of the imaging system by e.g., 3 fold, regardless of the sensor type that is used, whether it is a CMOS or CCD imager chip [41] .\nQuite interestingly, these features of lensfree on-chip microscopy are bound to further improve as new opto-electronic sensors are created, mostly driven by consumer electronics market, and in particular cellular phones. Smaller pixel opto-electronic chips with more megapixels that are constantly being introduced on cellular phone cameras will continue to improve the performance of lensfree on-chip microscopes by providing better resolution and\/or larger FOV, breaking the traditional trade-off between resolution and FOV of conventional lens-based optical microscopy [32] . As a matter of fact, the pixel count of cellular phone cameras over the last decade has been following Moore\u2019s Law (see Fig. 1 ), which empirically predicts doubling of the transistor count in Central Processing Units (CPUs) almost every 2 years. Stated differently, since their large-scale introduction in 2002, camera phones have continued to double their megapixel count almost every 2 years, reaching > 40 mega-pixels by the end of 2012. As a direct result of this continued growth, today lensfree imaging can routinely achieve giga-pixel range microscopic phase and amplitude images with an effective NA of e.g., ∼0.8\u20130.9 across a wide FOV of > 20 mm 2 [32] , [37] , [41] . 10.1371\/journal.pone.0076475.g001 Figure 1 A different view of Moore\u2019s law.\nA comparison of transistor counts in central processing units (CPUs) versus the pixel counts on cellular phone cameras. The transistor count has several data points for each year, while the cellular phone pixel count has only one data point, which corresponds to the maximum pixel count introduced in that year.\nOne of the remaining challenges for lensfree field-portable holographic microscopy is high-resolution colour imaging. Colour information in microscopy is rather significant as it serves as a contrast mechanism; for example colour may be used to differentiate different populations of cells using staining such as Trypan blue which is commonly used as a cell viability stain [42] . In addition to this, colour also has a psychological effect since cytotechnologists, pathologists and physicians are in general trained to observe specimen in colour.\nTo address this challenge for holographic on-chip microscopy, here we present a lensfree super-resolution colour microscope design, which is cost-effective and field-portable, weighing < 145 grams with dimensions of < 17×6×5 cm (see Fig. 2 ). In this field-portable colour microscope, we introduce an image processing technique that mitigates \u2018rainbow\u2019 like colour artefacts (see e.g., Fig. 3a ) that are characteristic of digital holography [43] \u2013 [47] . This colorization technique is based on transforming the lensfree RGB image into the YUV colour space [48] , [49] , which separates the brightness component of the image (i.e., Y channel) from its colour components (i.e., U and V channels). As a result of this, to achieve sub-micron spatial resolution in colour, there is no need to capture three distinct pixel super-resolved holograms, each with a different illumination colour (i.e., red, green and blue). In fact, it is sufficient to acquire only one pixel super-resolved lensfree image with a single illumination wavelength (e.g., green) which can serve as the Y channel of the colour image, preserving the sub-micron resolution over a large FOV. To obtain the remaining U and V channels of the colour image, since there is no need for pixel super-resolution, three LEDs at red, green and blue wavelengths would be sufficient. To demonstrate the resolution and colour imaging capabilities of this field-portable holographic microscope, we imaged a USAF resolution test chart and colour stained Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, which are widely used for pre-screening of cervical cancer [50] , [51] . 10.1371\/journal.pone.0076475.g002 Figure 2 A portable lensfree super-resolution colour microscope.\n(a) A photograph of the microscope that weighs < 145 grams. (b) A schematic diagram of the microscope; the LED array is separated into two groups, the first group enables pixel super-resolution based on source shifting, and it contains 17 green LEDs (λ \u200A=\u200A 527 nm) where each LED is butt-coupled to a multi-mode fiber and its emission passes through a colour filter as shown in the inset. The second group of LEDs enables the acquisition of a lower resolution colour image and it is composed of three LEDs (λ \u200A=\u200A 470 nm, 527 nm and 625 nm).

A previous approach that simply combines these three holograms into a RGB image results in a \u2018rainbow\u2019 like colour artefact. The current approach eliminates the colour noise by averaging the colours in the YUV colour space.

(c) A colour image with sub-micron spatial resolution (shown on the left) is rendered by replacing the lower resolution brightness component from (a) with the super-resolved brightness component from (b) in the YUV colour space.\nRecently, we also introduced a lensfree colour microscopy concept, which uses similar image processing methods to mitigate \u2018rainbow\u2019 like colour artefacts. However, this previous work was performed on a bench-top system within a well-controlled environment, which involved an optical table as well as a mechanical micro-stage and a monochromator to control the illumination position and the wavelength [52] . Here we introduce a novel design and the experimental implementation of a field-portable, light-weight and cost-effective colour microscope, which is based on inexpensive components such as an array of LEDs and 3D printed plastic enclosure. This field-portable, cost-effective and wide-field colour microscope could be significant especially for tele-pathology and micro-biology applications in resource limited environments and developing countries.\nMethods\nField-portable colour microscope design\nOur field-portable microscope (see Fig. 2 ) is designed to enable both pixel super-resolution and colour imaging by separating a set of low-cost LEDs that serve as the illumination source into two groups. The first group of LEDs enables pixel super-resolution imaging based on a shift of the source location; it contains 17 green LEDs that are butt-coupled to multi-mode fibers (each with 0.1 mm core diameter, Thorlabs, AFS-105\/125Y). The emission of these green LEDs is also passed through a colour filter after each fiber end (bandwidth ∼ 3 nm, centred around 532 nm, Thorlabs, FL532-3) to achieve the temporal coherence that is required for capturing high NA in-line holograms at the detector plane. To implement pixel-super resolution by source shifting, these green LEDs of the first group are arranged into a line, which is tilted 45 degrees relative to the image sensor edges (see Fig. 2 .b), such that the acquired lensfree holograms can be sub-pixel shifted along both X and Y directions.\nThe second group of LEDs enables the acquisition of lower resolution lensfree colour images, and it is composed of only three LEDs: one blue, one green, and one red, with λ \u200A=\u200A 470 nm, 527 nm and 625 nm, respectively. The illumination bandwidth of each one of these LEDs is rather broad, e.g., ∼ 45 nm, and since pixel super-resolution is not needed here, we did not employ a colour filter for these second group of LEDs. Each LED is still butt-coupled to a multi-mode fiber (0.1 mm core diameter), as illustrated in Fig. 2 .c.\nAll these 20 LEDs are individually controlled by a micro-controller (Atmel, ATmega8515), which sequentially turns on and off each LED within the array, while the image sensor captures lensfree holograms. The image capture and illumination are controlled in LabVIEW, and consequently the entire imaging process, including auto-exposure, is fully automated and is controlled using a laptop computer with a USB connection to the field-portable microscope.\nThe distance between the fibers\u2019 free ends (which are cleaved) and the object plane is designed to be ∼ 6 cm for two reasons: first, to allow the partially-coherent illumination light to gain sufficient spatial coherence before impinging on the sample plane, and second to ensure that each LED will illuminate the sample with an angle that is less than three degrees compared to the surface normal. This restriction is of paramount importance for pixel-super resolution based microscopy, since it enables capturing the same cross-section of the object in each sub-pixel shifted transmission image.\nThe above described multi-source illumination module is then connected to the sample holder and a cost-effective, custom-designed Z-stage (see Fig. 2 .b). This Z-stage has a coarse axial resolution of ∼ 10\u201315 µm, and it is used to move the CMOS sensor chip (1.67 µm pixel size, 10 mega-pixel, monochrome) up and down compared to the sample plane, which is required for achieving multi-height based phase-recovery. This multi-height phase-recovery process enables imaging of dense and connected samples, such as pathology slides, by iteratively eliminating the twin image noise, which is an artefact of in-line holography. This Z-stage is custom built from a lens-tube (Thorlabs, SM1L03) and a threading adapter (Thorlabs, SM1A10), which is glued to the field-portable microscope enclosure.\nDigital colorization of lensfree holographic images\nTo obtain high fidelity colour reproduction of the imaged object, three sequential lensfree holograms are initially acquired, each with a different illumination wavelength: blue, green and red (λ \u200A=\u200A 470 nm, 527 nm and 625 nm, respectively). Then, the background mean values of these holograms are equalized to digitally compensate for power and fiber coupling efficiency variations between different LEDs in our microscope design. These resulting in-line holograms are then back propagated to the object plane (see Fig. 3 .a). If these in-line holograms were simply combined into an RGB image [43] , a \u2018rainbow\u2019 like colour artefact would corrupt the image [43] \u2013 [47] . Therefore, to mitigate this artefact, the lensfree RGB image is initially converted into the YUV colour space using Colorspace Transformations package that is processed in MATLAB. The YUV colour space separates the brightness information (Y channel) from the colour information of the image (U and V channels), and therefore by averaging only the colour components with a rectangular window (∼ 13 µm edge size), the \u2018rainbow\u2019 like colour artefact of lensfree holographic images can be mitigated ( Fig. 3 .a). However, the spatial resolution of the resulting image becomes relatively low, and to enhance its resolution, the brightness component (Y channel) is entirely replaced by the pixel super-resolved image of the object ( Fig. 3 .b), which is obtained by using 17 green LEDs that are butt-coupled to a linear array of multi-mode fiber optic cables, as detailed earlier. The resulting colour image has the brightness component (Y channel) from Fig. 3 .b that is super-resolved, and the colour information (U-V channels) from Fig. 3 .a.\nTo further enhance the contrast of important sub-cellular features such as cell nuclei, which are typically absorbing and characterized by low intensity values in their lensfree transmission images, dark areas within the brightness (Y) channel were not coloured. These dark areas of an image were detected by thresholding the super-resolved brightness image. The resulting \u2018hybrid\u2019 YUV image is then converted back to RGB colour space to achieve high fidelity colour representation, as illustrated in Fig. 3 .c, which is in very good agreement with a conventional lens-based microscope image of the same sample.\nSource shifting based pixel super-resolution\nPixel super-resolution is a computational method that synthesizes one high-resolution image from a set of sub-pixel shifted lower resolution images of the same scene\/object [53] \u2013 [58] . The resulting high-resolution image is effectively equivalent to digitizing the object with a smaller pixel-size sensor. In our field-portable microscope, we shift the light source (LED) location by sequentially illuminating the sample with 17 colour filtered LEDs ( Fig. 2 .b), each of which is butt-coupled to a multi-mode fiber. The sub-pixel shifts between different holograms are evaluated automatically by implementing an iterative gradient method [55] . These relative shifts together with the lower resolution raw holograms are then provided as inputs to a least-square optimization problem to estimate a high-resolution (i.e., super-resolved) hologram that is consistent with the lower resolution measured lensfree holograms, while also penalizing for high-frequency components that might arise due to measurement noise. This optimization problem can be quickly solved by a conjugate gradient method [53] , which typically converges within ∼10 iterations.\nMulti-height phase-recovery\nA well-known artefact of in-line holography is the twin image noise, which corrupts the reconstructed holograms especially for spatially dense and connected samples [59] . To mitigate this twin image noise, various phase-recovery approaches were devised [36] , [59] . In this work, we implemented a multi-height phase-recovery approach since it does not need prior knowledge about the object shape or dimensions [60] \u2013 [64] . This iterative phase recovery approach uses few intensity measurements (e.g., 3\u20134), where each measurement is obtained at a different sample to sensor distance (i.e., height). The multi-height phase-recovery approach propagates the super-resolved holograms between different heights, and at each step the algorithm enforces the super-resolved hologram intensity, while keeping the resulting phase from the previous iteration untouched. After several iterations (e.g., 5\u201310) the missing phase is retrieved and the twin image noise is significantly suppressed. In our implementation, to change the distance between the image sensor and the sample planes, a cost-effective and custom-designed Z-stage was used (see Fig. 2 ). In case the sample is too thick to fit into the insertion tray of our microscope, various glass cover slips with different thicknesses can also be placed between the sample and the image sensor to change the sample\u2019s height compared to the sensor chip. An auto-focus algorithm was also implemented to automatically estimate the sample to sensor distance for each raw hologram without the need for an independent measurement of the sample height [14] .\nHologram reconstruction - focusing back to the object plane\nAfter the phase recovery steps described earlier, the final holographic reconstruction process includes the multiplication of the complex hologram with a reference wave, which in our imaging geometry can be approximated as a plane wave. The hologram can then be back propagated to the object plane by using the free space transfer function in the frequency domain [59] . This computational step results in a complex image, containing both the amplitude and phase information of the objects.\nResults\nTo quantify the spatial resolution of our field-portable microscope as a function of the number of heights used in our multi-height phase-recovery process, a 1951 USAF resolution test chart was imaged. In our image reconstruction process, we followed the computational flowchart shown in Fig. 3 .b. Fig. 4 .a shows the reconstructed amplitude image using only one height (Z \u200A=\u200A 694 µm), which clearly resolves a line-width of 0.87 µm using a CMOS imager chip that has a pixel size of 1.67 µm. Fig. 4 .b, on the other hand, shows the reconstructed amplitude image using two different heights (694 µm and 922 µm), which resolves a line-width of 0.98 µm. It is clear that using two different heights, the twin image noise is suppressed in comparison to Fig. 4 .a; however, the resolution is also slightly degraded due to possible errors in spatial registration of the two super-resolved holograms acquired at different heights. When using three heights (694 µm, 922 µm and 958 µm), no additional degradation in resolution is observed as illustrated in Fig. 4 .c; nevertheless the twin image noise is now significantly cleared (for instance, the dark vertical lines in Fig. 4 .a are not present in Fig. 4 .c). In these experiments, our goal was to illustrate this significant reduction of twin image related spatial artefacts, while also demonstrating that cross-registration of multi-height super-resolved holograms and their FOVs does not introduce a major resolution loss, still permitting sub-micron resolution as shown in Figs. 4 .b and 4.c. 10.1371\/journal.pone.0076475.g004 Figure 4 Quantification of the spatial resolution as a function of the number of heights used in our multi-height phase-recovery process.\n(a) Amplitude image that was reconstructed using one height. (b) Amplitude image that was reconstructed using two heights. (c) Amplitude image that was reconstructed using three heights. Cross sections of the smallest resolved gratings are provided below each reconstructed image. Pixel size of the monochrome CMOS chip used in our field-portable microscope is 1.67 µm. Note that using a CMOS imager chip that has a smaller pixel size (e.g., ∼1.1 µm) [37] , a higher spatial resolution of e.g., ∼300 nm can also be achieved using the same lensfree imaging technique [41] .\nTo further illustrate the performance of our field-portable colour microscope, next we imaged Pap smear samples over a wide FOV of ∼ 21 mm 2 , the results of which are summarized in Figs. 5 and 6 . Pap test is a cytology-based method that is extensively used to diagnose cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in women worldwide [51] . Optical microscopy can be considered as one of the gold standard techniques for early detection of premalignant and\/or malignant cells in a Pap smear, a task that is labour intensive and tedious, since in early stages of cervical cancer only a few cells among thousands of cells will statistically be abnormal. Moreover colour is important in Pap tests since it allows differentiating between different states\/types of cells on a Pap smear slide [65] . To create the lensfree colour images shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , the computational flowchart of Fig. 3 was utilized, where pixel super-resolved holograms were synthesized at three\/four different heights and five multi-height phase-recovery iterations were computed. Our reconstructed lensfree colour images provide very good agreement with 20× microscope objective (0.5 NA) images in Fig. 5 and with 10× microscope objective (0.25 NA) images in Fig. 6 , which are provided for comparison purposes. These results demonstrate the potential of this field-portable colour microscope for tele-pathology and micro-biology applications, making it especially relevant for various global health applications. 10.1371\/journal.pone.0076475.g005 Figure 5 A wide FOV (∼21 mm 2 ) lensfree colour image of a Pap smear sample (ThinPrep® preparation).\nThe Pap test was reconstructed using pixel super-resolved holograms acquired at four different heights (1069 µm, 1117 µm, 1159 µm and 1205 µm). For comparison purposes, 20× microscopes images (0.5 NA objective lens) of the same specimen are also provided. 10.1371\/journal.pone.0076475.g006 Figure 6 A wide FOV (∼21 mm 2 ) lensfree colour image of a Pap smear sample (ThinPrep® preparation).\nThe Pap test was reconstructed using pixel super-resolved holograms acquired at three different heights (860 µm, 1040 µm and 1080 µm). For comparison purposes, 10× microscopes images (0.25 NA objective lens) are also provided, located above their corresponding lensfree colour images.\nDiscussion\nSince the low-resolution colour image is overlaid on the high-resolution brightness image, it is evident that our microscope has a significantly better resolution in the brightness channel than in the colour channel. Unlike the brightness channel, where the spatial resolution is determined by the effective pixel size of the image sensor after pixel super-resolution, e.g., ≤500 nm, the colour resolution is determined by the size of the averaging window in the YUV colour space (e.g., ∼ 13 µm), which is used to mitigate the rainbow colour artefacts in reconstructed holographic images. However, in the context of Pap tests or pathology in general, this resolution mismatch between the colour (i.e., UV) and brightness (i.e., Y) channels is irrelevant. Sub-micrometer resolution is required in clinical pathology applications to observe the cells\u2019 boundaries and nuclei; this information is provided in the brightness channel of our field-portable microscope. On the other hand, the colour information is used as a visual marker to distinguish among different cell types; therefore lower colour resolution requirements are acceptable. Moreover, the physical process of colour staining creates an inherent resolution loss as the dye molecules diffuse inside the stained cell, creating smoothened boundaries. Consequently, the presented microscopic colorization scheme satisfies pathology needs, as it provides accurate colour information that would have been normally concealed by the rainbow artefacts of holographic imaging.\nTo validate that our field-portable microscope can satisfy pathology needs, we specifically imaged some abnormal cells in a Pap smear as shown in Fig. 7 (marked by white arrows). A professional cytotechnologist confirmed the abnormality of these cells beforehand and the cells were imaged with our field-portable device. Abnormal cells have generally distinct spatial features such as a large nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and\/or an irregular cytoplasm shape. Figures 7 .a-c illustrate the lensfree colour images obtained by our field-portable microscope using four different sample heights (i.e., 1069 µm, 1117 µm, 1159 µm and 1205 µm). These lensfree images shown in Figs. 7 .a-c agree very well with the corresponding 20 × microscope objective (0.5 NA) images that are provided in Figs. 7 .d-f, respectively, illustrating that our field-portable colour microscope preserves the spatial features of interest within abnormal cells. Here we should also emphasize that this work does \u2018not\u2019 claim automated diagnosis of Pap smears and does \u2018not\u2019 aim to replace the pathologist or the cytotechnologist; but rather aims to create a field-portable and cost-effective high-throughput microscope that can provide decent quality and high-resolution colour images of various specimen that can be used by professionals for e.g., tele-pathology and remote diagnostics purposes. 10.1371\/journal.pone.0076475.g007 Figure 7 Lensfree computational images of abnormal cells in a Pap smear sample.\n(a), (b) and (c) lensfree Pap smear images of abnormal cells (pointed by white arrows), which generally exhibit large nucleus in comparison to their cytoplasm as well as an irregular cytoplasm shape. (d), (e) and (f) microscope comparison images for (a), (b) and (c), respectively, obtained using a 20× microscope objective (0.5 NA).\nIt is interesting to note that in this computational colour microscope, while the usage of multiple heights offers superior twin image elimination, it also comes with the cost of partially degrading the spatial resolution of the image as well increasing the reconstruction time. Typically, the twin image noise is strong when the specimen is spatially dense and connected, and it gets weaker when the specimen is spatially sparse. Therefore, if sub-micron resolution is sufficient for a certain imaging application\/need, the number of heights to be used in the multi-height phase-recovery process depends on the spatial density of the sample of interest. For samples that are spatially dense and\/or require the investigation of fine features obscured by twin image related artefacts (as in the case of Pap smear samples, see e.g., Fig. 5 ), the multi-height phase-recovery process might require more than two different heights in order to produce acceptable results and effectively eliminate the twin image noise. As a solution to this need, our field-portable colour microscope offers the flexibility to acquire super-resolved holograms at any necessary number of sample heights, thus enabling computational colour imaging of dense and connected specimen. Finally, we should emphasize that using a CMOS imager chip that has an even smaller pixel size (e.g., ∼1.1 µm) [37] , a higher spatial resolution of ∼ 300 nm can also be achieved using the same computational imaging technique [41] .\nConclusions\nWe demonstrated a field-portable colour microscope that can achieve sub-micron resolution over a wide FOV of e.g., > 21 mm 2 . Given its light weight (< 145 grams) and small dimensions (< 17 cm×6 cm×5 cm), this computational microscope is especially suitable for field use. This microscope\u2019s design combines pixel super-resolution and multi-height phase-recovery techniques with a colorization algorithm to significantly reduce \u2018rainbow\u2019 like artefacts observed in colour holographic imaging. To demonstrate the resolution and colour imaging capabilities of this computational microscope, we imaged a resolution test target and stained Pap smear samples. This light-weight, cost-effective and wide-field colour microscope might be rather useful for tele-pathology and micro-biology applications in resource poor settings and developing countries.\nReferences\nReferences\n1 Wang J ( 2006 ) Electrochemical biosensors: towards point-of-care cancer diagnostics .

However, such long-term follow-up evaluations are scarce in healthcare implementation science, being largely relegated to the \"need for further research\" section of most project write-ups. This article explores the variety of conceptualizations of implementation sustainability, as well as behavioral and organizational factors that influence the maintenance of gains. It highlights the finer points of design considerations and draws on our own experiences with measuring sustainability, framed within the rich theoretical and empirical contributions of others. In addition, recommendations are made for designing sustainability analyses. This article is one in a Series of articles documenting implementation science frameworks and approaches developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI).\nBackground\nWhen quality improvement (QI) programs reach initial success but fail to maintain it, the need for guidance in evaluating the lasting effects of implementation becomes evident. However, any real measurement of long-term effects is rare and sporadic in the burgeoning discipline of healthcare implementation science. Akin to other aspects of healthcare, such as the pharmaceutical industry's post-marketing phase of pharmacovigilance for monitoring ongoing drug quality and safety, more prospective studies that follow implementation program dynamics over the long term are needed. As things stand, very little is known about what eventually happens to outcomes \u2013 or whether new programs even still exist after implementation is completed [ 1 ].\nThis article is one in a Series of articles documenting implementation science frameworks and approaches developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI). QUERI is briefly outlined in Table 1 and is described in more detail in previous publications [ 2 , 3 ]. The Series' introductory article [ 4 ] highlights aspects of QUERI that are related specifically to implementation science, and describes additional types of articles contained in the Series . In this case, the focus is on a key measurement issue \u2013 sustainability, which is a discrete component of the QUERI model's fourth phase of refinement and spread. Table 1 The VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) was launched in 1998. QUERI was designed to harness VA's health services research expertise and resources in an ongoing system-wide effort to improve the performance of the VA healthcare system and, thus, quality of care for veterans. QUERI researchers collaborate with VA policy and practice leaders, clinicians, and operations staff to implement appropriate evidence-based practices into routine clinical care. They work within distinct disease- or condition-specific QUERI Centers and utilize a standard six-step process: \u20031) Identify high-risk\/high-volume diseases or problems. \u20032) Identify best practices. \u20033) Define existing practice patterns and outcomes across the VA and current variation from best practices. \u20034) Identify and implement interventions to promote best practices. \u20035) Document that best practices improve outcomes. \u20036) Document that outcomes are associated with improved health-related quality of life. Within Step 4, QUERI implementation efforts generally follow a sequence of four phases to enable the refinement and spread of effective and sustainable implementation programs across multiple VAmedical centers and clinics. The phases include: \u20031) Single site pilot, \u20032) Small scale, multi-site implementation trial, \u20033) Large scale, multi-region implementation trial, and \u20034) System-wide rollout.\nWe explore the concept of sustainability and related design considerations in the context of our experiences from a QUERI project, where we sought to measure whether implemented changes were sustained (see Table 2 for project details). Such knowledge is essential to the creation of durable, exportable implementation products that can be broadly rolled-out across the VA healthcare system, an expectation consistent with the QUERI framework. Table 2 QUERI-HIV\/Hepatitis implementation project summary MAIN IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT: Background: Although studies have shown that real-time computerized clinical reminders (CR) modestly improve essential chronic disease care processes, no studies have compared the separate and combined effects of CR and group-based quality improvement (GBQI) collaboratives. Objectives: To evaluate CR, GBQI, and the interaction of the two in improving HIV quality (Step 4, Phase 2 per the QUERI framework). Methods: Using a quasi-experimental design, 4091 patients in 16 VA facilities were stratified into four groups: CR, GBQI, CR+GBQI, and controls. CR facilities received software and technical assistance in implementing real time reminders. GBQI facilities participated in a year-long collaborative emphasizing rapid cycle quality improvement targets of their choice. Ten predefined clinical endpoints included the receipt of highly active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, screening and prophylaxis for opportunistic infection, as well as monitoring of immune function and viral load. Optimal overall care was defined as receiving all care for which the patient was eligible. Interventional effects were estimated using clustered logistic regression, controlling for clinical and facility characteristics. Human subjects' protection approval was obtained. Results: Compared to controls, CR facilities improved the likelihood of hepatitis A, toxoplasma, and lipid screening. GBQI alone improved the likelihood of pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis, immune-monitoring on ARVs \u2013 but reduced the likelihood of hepatitis B screening. CR+GBQI facilities improved hepatitis A and toxoplasma screening, as well as immune-monitoring on ARV. CR+GBQI facilities improved the proportion of patients receiving optimal overall care (OR = 2.65; CI: 1.16\u20136.0), while either modality alone did not. Conclusions: The effectiveness of CR and GBQI interventions varied by endpoint. The combination of the two interventions was effective in improving overall optimal care quality. SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS SUPPLEMENT: Objectives: To ascertain whether the implemented interventions were sustained and became part of routine care, we measured the original outcomes for one additional year and evaluated continued intervention use at selected sites. Methods: Interviews with key informants selected from the study sites revealed that some sites had ceased using the interventions, and some control sites had adopted them; analyzing odds of patients receiving guideline-based HIV care (HIVGBC) compared to controls no longer made sense. Thus, we evaluated sustained performance as follows: At the facility-rather than the arm-level, we examined raw rates of patients receiving HIVGBC at only those facilities in the intervention arms that had significant effects in the study year to determine whether they continued to show a significant increase in these rates in the following year, compared to their raw rate at baseline. We also conducted a qualitative component. Based on formative evaluation results assessing the use and usefulness of the reminders, we asked informants if identified barriers were subsequently removed and recommendations heeded. Also, we evaluated the extent to which staff members from the sites that participated in the collaboratives were still conducting rapid-cycle improvement methods to address local care quality problems; whether they still maintained the social networks established during the original study, and the degree to which they were used to disseminate subsequent quality improvement change ideas, and shared network contacts with \u2013 and taught the method to new staff. Results: For hepatitis A screening, we found that 4 out of the 5 sites that showed a significant increase in their raw rate at 12 months, also showed a significant increase in their raw rate at 24 months compared to baseline (p = .05). For the other four significant indicators of HIVGBC (hepatitis C and toxoplasma screening, CD4\/viral load and lipids monitoring), all sites that showed significant increases in their raw performance rates at 12 months, showed a significant increase in their raw rates at 24 months compared to baseline. Conclusions: Intervention effects were sustained for one year at nearly all the sites that showed significant increases in performance during the study period. Nearly all sites exposed to reminders were using at least some of the 10 available in the follow-up year. Collaborative methods were still being used, but only at the most activated of the original study sites.\nHIV\/Hepatitis QUERI Center project\nIn a complex and lengthy implementation project, we compared the separate and combined effects of real-time, computerized clinical reminders and group-based quality improvement collaboratives at 16 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare facilities for one year, in order to evaluate each intervention, as well as the interaction of the two, in improving HIV care quality [ 5 ]. Then, to ascertain whether performance gains associated with the implemented interventions were sustained and whether or not they had become part of routine care (i.e., had been 'routinized'), we sought guidance from the related literature about how to measure ongoing performance and continued use of the interventions during a follow-up year.\nQuestions regarding sustaining QI have been addressed in existing work (e.g., Greenhalgh et al. [ 6 ], Fixsen et al. [ 7 ], and Øvretveit [ 8 ]); however, we failed to find enough detail in this literature to actually direct the design and conduct of a sustainability analysis. Therefore, in this article we strive to provide such direction. First, we briefly explore what is known about the lasting effects of quality improvement interventions in regard to long-term behavior change, as well as knowing why gains achieved in performance often fail after implementation. We then provide guidance for implementers interested in measuring not just whether QI changes were likely to sustain, but whether they actually did. We describe important considerations for designing such an analysis, drawing from our own effort, and also framed within the rich theoretical and empirical contributions of others.\nThe concept of sustainability\nSimply describing implemented interventions as successes or failures leaves too much room for interpretation: What is 'success?' What is 'failure?' What is the timeline by which such conclusions are drawn?\nA first step to correcting these ambiguities is making a strong distinction between achieving improvement in outcomes and sustaining them. Achieving improvements generally refers to gains made during the implementation phase of a project that typically provides a generous supply of support for the intervention, in the way of personnel and other resources. However, sustaining improvements refers to \"holding the gains\" [p.7, [ 8 ]] for a variably defined period after the funding has ceased and project personnel have been withdrawn \u2013 an expectation identified as a major challenge to the longevity of public health programs [ 9 ]. For this reason, it behooves implementation scientists to keep the longer view in mind when designing interventions, including those that potentially will be exported to other venues.\nTo paraphrase Fixsen and colleagues, the goal of sustainability is not only the long-term survival of project-related changes, but also continued effectiveness and capacity to adapt or replace interventions or programs within contexts that constantly change [ 7 ]. Thus, sustainability also can refer to embedding practices within an organization [ 6 , 10 - 14 ]. Failure to do so can be a result of either a poor climate for implementation or poor commitment by users because of a misfit with local values [ 15 ].\nFor measurement purposes, this multi-faceted definition needs to be understood and sustainability addressed early in a project. Such an assessment would be unlikely without a proper formative evaluation (FE) built into the original study design [ 16 ], as discussed below. This includes assessment of relapse. Although some degree of backsliding happens in any attempt to change behavior, relapsing to old behaviors should be accounted for [ 10 , 11 ]. From a measurement perspective, a decision has to be made regarding how much relapse can be tolerated and still allow investigators to call the new behavior sustained.\nAs the mention of backsliding suggests, sustainability, as we define it, differs from \u2013 but may depend upon \u2013 replication when the innovation is expected to spread to additional units or sites within an organization. Similar to fidelity, replication is concerned with how well an innovation stays true to the original validated intervention model after being spread to different cohorts [ 17 ]. [We use 'validated' not to indicate testing in highly controlled settings, but rather in regard to testing in more typical, real-time circumstances.] Racine argues that sustained effects can be achieved only through the reliable spread of an innovation, or the faithful replication of it [ 18 ].\nSlippage of the intervention from the original achievement of change related to its core elements can occur as a result of influences from multiple levels of the organization, due to, for example, local staffing conditions, administrators losing interest, or changes in organizational goals. Slippage can be limited through performance monitoring, standards enforcement, and creating receptive subcultures [ 19 ], all strategies requiring some degree of infrastructure support. Yet, shortage of such support is precisely why many QI interventions eventually disappear.\nThere are four prerequisites for realizing program benefits over time: 1) adequate financial resources, 2) clear responsibility and capacity for maintenance, 3) an intervention that will not overburden the system in maintenance requirements [ 20 ], and 4) an intervention that fits the implementing culture and variations of the patient population [ 21 ]. Skeptics may argue that these organizational components rarely coincide in the real world. Some see standardizing QI interventions as a pitfall that should be avoided, while some seem less worried about the negative effects of variation because they see it as a necessary adaptation to local environments [ 22 , 23 ]. Preventing adaptation at this level may explain why an intervention did or did not sustain, so imposing fidelity can be a double-edged sword. This can be better understood and clarified by measuring it through both the project's FE and, later, in the follow-up analysis.\nTo construct an informative definition of sustainability, it is important to keep in mind the fundamental objective of implementation and QI: To improve patient health. For example, effectiveness measured by number of smoking quits or higher screening rates for at-risk patients are typical of implementation project objectives; actual improvements in morbidity and mortality are the inferred endpoints of interest. The overarching concern of any QI effort should be for an intervention or program that survives long enough to lead to improvements in patient health that can be measured. That being said, establishing the relationship between a particular QI strategy and its related health outcome(s) may be somewhat ambitious considering the barriers [ 24 ].\nFollowing Øvretveit [ 8 ], we conceptually define sustainability in two ways: 1) continued use of the core elements of the interventions, and 2) persistence of improved performance. Operationally defining and measuring 'continued use,' 'core elements,' 'persistence,' and 'improved performance' was a challenge for us \u2013 an experience that formed the basis of this article.\nFactors affecting sustainability and its measurement\nSpreading innovations within service organizations can range from \"letting it happen\" to \"making it happen,\" depending on the degree of involvement by stakeholders [ 6 ]. The former passive mode is unprogrammed, uncertain and unpredictable, whereas, the latter active mode is planned, regulated and managed [ 25 ].\nConsider the three situations in Figure 1 . In each, performance improvements, shown on the vertical axes, decline when the active phase ends although each ultimately represents a different outcome. In the first situation, the active phase shows initial gains (i.e., sustainability success ) but performance still decays somewhat when support is withdrawn. However, given a sufficiently receptive environment, improvements can remain above the baseline level in the long-term. Alternatively, the second curve shows performance returning to baseline, and in the worst case, dropping below it, indicating sustainability failure . Although either the first or second circumstance could result from a situation where support for the intervention is relatively passive, active maintenance may make all the difference in long-term success; and sustainability failure seems particularly likely if the level of support provided for the intervention during implementation is withdrawn after its completion (e.g., enriched clinic staff, research assistants, leadership endorsement). Figure 1 Three possible outcomes of performance improvement: Successful, failed, and enhanced. (T1 = baseline period, T2 = implementation period, T3 = follow-up period).\nIn the final situation, which clearly reflects an active mode, a successfully implemented intervention with follow-up booster activity at certain intervals sustains performance improvements, albeit in a somewhat saw-tooth pattern. Declines are attenuated as a result of the periodic nudge, as without occasional reinforcement or higher order structural changes to encourage institutionalization of the new 'steady state,' the new behavior will eventually decay or revert back to its previous state.\nIn identifying a need for a better model of the maintenance process in health behavior change, Orleans argued that more effort should be focused on maintenance promotion rather than on relapse prevention [ 26 ]. Yet, how much do we really know about what is needed to prevent slips and relapses from occurring until an intervention with its associated performance gains is institutionalized? This question cannot begin to be answered until one knows whether implemented change has actually succeeded or failed in the longer term, and to know that, it has to be measured.\nBeing cognizant of models describing human behavior and lifestyle change may benefit the selection of suitable sustainability measures to study the behavior of providers and organizations. Models most frequently used are based on assumptions that people are motivated by reason or logic, albeit within contexts influenced by social norms or beliefs (e.g., Health Beliefs Model [ 27 ] and Theory of Reasoned Action [ 28 ]). However, logic is not always a primary driver of behavior [ 29 ] but when it is, the logic may be generated in regard to cultural or structural factors (i.e., peer norms or an individual's relationship with his\/her supervisor). Measures that capture information about what drives continued participation in QI efforts would be useful.\nWhile change through the internalization of new processes is essential for sustaining implementation, one factor that we have observed to be associated with sustainability failure is a lack of systems-thinking. That is, to capitalize on gains made during the active phase, and to design proper sustainability measures, one must view organizations as complex, adaptive systems [ 30 ]. In such systems, processes that promise to be inherently (albeit unintentionally) supportive of the anticipated change can be leveraged with careful planning to both generate and maintain a QI change. Because routinization of innovations drives sustainability, measures should take into consideration the degree to which a given practice has been woven into standard practice at each study site, such as its centrality in the daily process flow and its location in the practice models held and adhered to by personnel [ 31 , 32 ] (e.g., the Level of Institutionalization instrument or LoIn [ 12 ]).\nMeasuring sustainability as persistence\nIn seeking examples of studies that included any degree of follow-up evaluation, we found that evaluation of health promotion programs, primarily in regard to improving individual behavior, and continued concordance with treatment guidelines after implementation or dissemination, targeting either provider or organizational performance, were the two most common foci. This is similar to what Greenhalgh's group found in searching for reports on diffusion of service innovations [ 6 ]. Overall, however, our impression, like others' [ 6 ], was that reported analyses of sustained effects are rare (see Table 3 for examples from our search). We speculate that this scarcity is due to one or more of the following reasons. Table 3 Examples of studies reporting follow-up evaluation of implemented interventions Authors Design Intervention Intervention target Intervention length Outcome measured Post-intervention sustainability period Knox et al., 2003 [46] Quasi-experiment, pre-post comparison Multi-component suicide prevention program USAF personnel (patient-level) 1 year Relative suicide risk factor rates 1 year Harland et al., 1999 [47] RCT, pre-post comparison 1\u20136 motivational interviews, with or without financial incentive General medicine practice patients (patient-level) 3 months Self-reported physical activity 1 year Shye et al., 2004 [48] Multi-faceted intervention trial, pre-post comparison (1) Basic strategy: guideline, education, clinical supports (2) Augmented strategy: basic program with social worker added HMO PCPs (provider-level) 10 months Rates of female patients who asked about domestic violence 3 months Sanci et al., 2000, 2005 [49,50] RCT, pre-post comparison Multi-faceted adolescent health education program General medicine practice physicians (provider-level) 3 months Observer ratings of skills, self-perceived competency, tested knowledge 4 months, 10 months, 5 years Perlstein et al., 2000 [51] Pre-post comparison Implemented bronchiolitis care guideline Pediatricians who cared for infants 0\u20131 year hospitalized with bronchiolitis (provider-level) -- Patient volumes, length of stay, use of ancillary resources 3 years Brand et al., 2005 [52] Program evaluation COPD management guideline Hospital physicians (provider-level) -- Guideline concordance, attitudes and barriers to guidelines, access to available guidelines 2 years Morgenstern et al., 2003 [53] Quasi-experiment, pre-post comparison Multi-component acute stroke treatment education program Community laypersons (patient-level); Community- and ED-based physicians and EMS responders (provider-level); Stroke care policies (organization-level) 15 months Number of acute stroke patients who received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator 6 months Bere et al., 2006 [54] Controlled trial, pre-post comparison (1) Fruit and vegetable education program (2) No-cost access to school fruit program School-age students (patient-level) 1 year All-day fruit and vegetable intake 1 year Shepherd et al., 2000 [55] Systematic review of controlled comparisons with pre-post analysis Health education interventions that promote sexual risk reduction in women Sexually active women in any setting, treated by any provider type (patient-level) Varied from 1 day to 3 years (most lasted 1 to 3 months) Behavioral outcomes (e.g, condom use, fewer partners, or abstinence, fewer STDs) Varied from 1 month to 6 months (most were up to 3 months) Note. To identify studies that measured sustainability, we searched PubMed for reports that included any follow-up analyses of interventions or program effects, using keyword searches for terms such as 'sustain,' 'sustained,' 'sustainability,' and 'follow-up.'\n\u2022 Since there must be a time gap between when a QI study ends and when sustainability can be appropriately measured, finding a suitable funding mechanism can be a challenge.\n\u2022 An analysis of sustainability, especially if designed post hoc, is limited in what can be evaluated.\n\u2022 Good measures of sustainability are not common and\/or not immediately obvious, depending on the clarity of one's operational definition of sustainability.\nWe differentiate between sustainability analyses that are premeditated (e.g., included in an implementation project's formative evaluation and those designed after the fact. The fundamental difference between the two is that the former is limited to measuring the likelihood that changes will sustain , as the project will end before the maintenance period occurs. There are several measures that could be included in an FE that would elucidate and potentially enhance realization of this concept [ 16 ]. The latter type of analysis is limited to measuring whether use of the intervention or performance gains actually did sustain without an ability to influence the probability of that occurrence. The LoIn instrument [ 12 ] is perhaps the single best example of this latter approach.\nWith enough forethought and funding, using both premeditated and post hoc approaches would be optimal. However, without the value of forethought we conducted a post hoc-designed evaluation and, in doing so, realized how uncertain we were about what to measure, when and how to measure it, and how to get funded to do so. What follows is a synthesis of what we learned from our own observations and what useful insights we gleaned from the relevant literature about designing a sustainability analysis of either type.\nWhat to measure\nThe goal of QUERI implementation is to create effective innovations that remain robust and sustainable under a dynamic set of circumstances and thus ensure continued reduction in the gaps between best and current practices associated with patient outcomes. Hence, knowing precisely what has been sustained becomes important from a performance and thus measurement perspective \u2013 and therein lies the challenge. Relative to long-term effectiveness, what is it about the intervention or program that should survive? And what about the organizational context needs to be understood in order to adequately interpret what the results mean? The following provide one set of dimensions of improvements that can potentially be turned into critical measures of sustainability, depending on whether the analysis is part of a project FE or conducted post hoc. These dimensions include: 1) intervention fit, 2) intervention fidelity, 3) intervention dose, and 4) level of the intervention target.\nIntervention fit\nEffective interventions targeting any level of the organization are not necessarily enduringly useful ones. There is good evidence showing that interventions that are not carefully adapted to the local context will not endure [ 6 ]. Sullivan and colleagues described a 'bottom-up' approach using provider input to design a QI program that increased provider buy-in and, hence, sustainability of the intervention [ 33 ]. When improvements fail to persist, the researcher's challenge is in drawing the right conclusion about whether the intervention failed because of external influences that occurred after the intervention period, or because it was not considered to be all that useful to the organization in the long-run [ 15 ].\nIn our study, we suspected that sites that were marginally enthusiastic about participating in the modified collaborative may have felt obliged to participate for the sake of the project, but in actuality, failed to perceive any benefit for the long-term. Modest enthusiasm most likely explains some of the poor performance observed. Collaborative participation, as part of our strategy for continuous quality improvement (CQI), could not \u2013 and did not for some in our project \u2013 work with such an attenuated level of interest. More diagnostic FE [ 16 ] might have enhanced our intervention mapping to identify and address this issue early on. ('Intervention mapping' is a borrowed term that describes the development of health promotion interventions and refers to a nonlinear, recursive path from recognition of a problem or gap to the identification of a solution [ 34 ].\nImplemented interventions generally consist of multiple components, some of which do not demonstrate success. Solberg et al. found that bundling guidelines into a single clinical recommendation is more acceptable to the providers who are meant to follow them [ 35 ]. However, in the reminder study arm, we implemented a clinical reminder package that consisted of automated provider alerts for 10 separate aspects of evidence-based HIV treatment. Despite the incomplete success of the full software package (i.e., all the alerts in the package did not generate improvements) it was rolled out intact based on a policy decision. Since sustainability was not an issue for the reminders in the package that had failed to produce significant performance improvements during the project, we simply did not analyze their individual effects in the quantitative aspect of the follow-up sustainability assessment. During interviews with key site-based informants after the study was completed, we learned that some of the implemented reminders were not regarded as helpful by local clinicians in making treatment decisions, which helped us explain their failure to produce significant improvements. In more complex, multi-faceted QI interventions, components should not be so inextricably linked, so that independent evaluation of successful ones is still possible.\nIntervention fidelity\nBecause of the general complexity of implementation interventions, it is important to evaluate the discrepancy between what the intervention was like in the original implementation versus what it becomes when sustainability is subsequently measured. Inability to unequivocally credit improvements to a particular intervention within a complex improvement strategy is a common shortcoming of QI research [ 1 ]. 'Outcome attribution failure' can be a major, and sometimes insoluble, problem in this type of analysis, making it imperative to fully grasp how an intervention morphs with each new implementation unit, at each new site or new phase of roll-out. Wheeler [ 36 ] recalls the contributions of Shewhart's 1931 report on controlling variation in product quality in the manufacturing industry. An important message from his work is that normal variations should be differentiated from those that have 'assignable causes,' which create important but undesirable changes in the product over time.\nAlthough all components of the reminder package were offered to all VA sites after our project's completion, we made no attempt to control local drift in the software or its usage. This could have clouded interpretation of performance in the sustainability period, if we had not interviewed key informants about which specific reminders were still being used and under what circumstances. While quantifying the amount of drift in the way that the reminders were being used would have been preferable, we were at least able to describe variation that occurred based on local need or preference.\nThe QUERI framework recommends enhancing and sustaining uptake with ongoing or periodic monitoring at the local level to lower the fidelity gap, because rarely is the first iteration of an intervention perfect. Local adaptations\/variations are not, within the caveat of staying true to the actual basis of the targeted best practice, anathema to the four-phased QUERI model, especially if they are designed on an appropriate rationale to actually improve goal achievement. However, it is clear that changing circumstances within the organizational environment can be a significant threat to sustainability. Implementation researchers could use more guidance about how to distinguish between the core features of an intervention that should not be allowed to drift, and those features that can be adapted. In any event, understanding how an innovation may have been adapted over time, or why it was discontinued are both important to assess when trying to determine the black box of implementation and its ongoing effects, especially during the early stages of a phased roll-out when refinements can, and should, be made. Therefore, understanding and implementing desirable changes to an intervention should be part of the overall implementation strategy.\nIntervention dose\nThe longevity of an adopted intervention may be a direct function of original implementation intensity. The twin concepts of 'dose delivered' and 'dose received', referring to the amount of exposure to and uptake of an implementation intervention [ 37 ], provide a focus for related measurement, although only the latter is important to a post hoc-designed analysis. To measure the dose received in a post hoc analysis, a researcher would ask what proportion of the intervention was still being used by the intended targets. After we implemented the study collaborative in our project, a national VA HIV collaborative was conducted during the follow-up year. Based on key informant interviews, sites in the study collaborative that subsequently participated in the national collaborative seemed more enthusiastic about continuing to use collaborative strategies for continuous quality improvement. For example, in terms of the use of social networks for sharing QI information and usage of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to address new quality problems. We saw this as a clear indication of dose response, which makes a case for incorporating measurement of any booster activity, either prospectively as part of the project's FE, or retrospectively as part of the sustainability analysis.\nIntervention target\nMeasuring sustainability depends on the change that is targeted and whether the focus of the intervention is the individual (i.e., provider or patient) or the organization (i.e., facility or integrated healthcare system), or both. Implementing change at one level while taking into consideration the context of the others (e.g., individual versus group, facility, or system), will produce the most long-lasting impact [ 38 ]. Effecting changes in individual versus organizational performance are qualitatively different tasks that require not only different instruments for measuring changes, but acquisition of in-depth knowledge of the processes that control adoption or assimilation of the innovation at either level [ 6 ]. Activities associated with the project's FE, such as assessment of facilitators and barriers, will facilitate this latter aspect.\nOur implementation targets were individual providers who operate within the small HIV clinic environment at each VA medical center. However, buy-in and support from clinic leadership was an obvious factor impacting implementation effectiveness of both system interventions [ 39 ]. Our sustainability analysis did not include a repeat of this assessment, but, in hindsight, its inclusion would have facilitated our interpretation of performance and usage in our follow-up. Just as targeting levels of individual and organizational behavior provide an important framework to maximize success of implementation efforts, being mindful of what happens at multiple levels after the project also applies to measuring success of sustained QI.\nSustainability measurement should flow logically from and within the overall project evaluation, thus highlighting the limitations of our post hoc type of approach. However, measuring some of these critical dimensions as part of the project's FE will go a long way toward explaining why an intervention failed or succeeded in the long-run.\nWhen to measure\nThe amount of time that is necessary to follow intervention effects and\/or usage is quite variable. In the examples listed in Table 3 , evaluations lasted anywhere from several months after implementation to several years. Ideally, one would keep measuring performance \u2013 and contextual events \u2013 until decline shows some indication of stabilizing or the intervention is no longer useful. Some may argue that the more astute investigator will specify the length of the follow-up period based on a theoretical perspective because then, if the follow-up plan becomes altered, they can at least appeal to theory to assess confidence in their results. Because we were limited by funding in our own analysis, the follow-up period was artificially restricted to one year past the end of active implementation. Another difficulty in timing sustainability measurement, described by Titler [ 40 ], is knowing where to draw the line between the implementation and follow-up periods. Distinguishing between lingering improvements from the implementation and true persistence of effects from institutionalization also is a challenge [ 40 ].\nIn our post hoc analysis, we examined rates of indicated care received by eligible patients at sites within each intervention arm that yielded a significant performance gain during the study year, in order to determine whether that gain persisted in the following year. Figure 2 shows actual performance measurements from our study for appropriate hepatitis A screening in patients with HIV in three time periods: 1) 12 months prior to launch, 2) during the year-long implementation, and 3) during 12 months of follow-up. Judging from the downward trends in screening performance, we probably did not capture the performance nadir, so one year was probably not enough. Our decision to use a one-year follow-up was admittedly arbitrary and based somewhat on symmetry, given that the two earlier periods also were that length. Ideally, the evaluation period should be long enough to capture the lowest level to which performance will naturally decline, either with or without booster efforts to determine success or failure. Figure 2 Site-level performance for hepatitis A screening in HIV patients before, during and after a one-year-implementation trial. Indicated by letter and number, sites implemented either clinical reminders (R), collaboratives (C), or both (C+R).\nThe amount of time it takes to measure long-term effects is dependent on the speed of spread [ 6 ]. QUERI researchers are not always actively involved in exporting successful QI strategies to other parts of the VA system, thereby making it difficult to know the level of penetration when follow-up evaluation is conducted. Yet due to our close collaboration with the VA central office responsible for HIV care delivery, we did have access to information regarding the level of penetration of our study interventions. Knowing what was happening in the field enabled us to gauge the effects of external events, such as the timing in regard to readiness for subsequent exportation of the reminder software, as well as the schedule for the national collaborative. Then again, there is the temptation for some to use unanticipated external events to excuse a failed intervention. Sustainable QI should be robust to these influences.\nCQI methodology dictates that internal follow-up measurement is needed as long as the intervention or program remains useful to the organization [ 41 ]. Adding to that, our recommendation for estimating how long to follow performance after implementation would be that 'longer is always better,' although what is feasible rightfully tends to override any other consideration. In translating tenets of CQI to the four-phased QUERI implementation model described in Table 2 , the principle remains the same. However, the responsibility for follow-up changes at each phase, such that a move toward creating routine national performance measures should be considered at national roll-out.\nHow to measure\nMethods used in evaluating the success of implemented QI interventions and strategies are 'messy' at best, and measuring their longer-term effects is no different. A number of designs have been recommended. Focused audit studies have a built-in cycle for monitoring QI impact against accepted and expected standards over time [ 42 ]. Other approaches include single case studies and quasi-experimental pre\/post-test comparisons [ 43 ]. We used the latter design to evaluate the implementation of the clinical reminders and collaborative, although this type of design presented our major challenge in evaluating intervention sustainability for two reasons. First, the non-intervention sites became contaminated after the initial study period because they were allowed to adopt the reminders and participate in the national collaborative, thus preventing any further utility as a comparison group. Second, this snapshot-type of approach prevented a more finely grained examination of when the level of decay might have warranted booster treatments.\nAlthough the lack of an effective control group was not a problem that we could remedy, a more robust approach would have been to use a time-series design [ 44 ]. Ideally, the analytic window would have included monthly measurements over the entire 24-month period, while restricting spread of the interventions to the control sites during that time. In hindsight, multiple measurements during the follow-up phase at the very least would have allowed us to take advantage of this potentially useful information.\nBecause our follow-up analysis was not included as a component of the original design, our default post hoc strategy was to compare rates of patients receiving evidence-based HIV care at only those facilities in the intervention arms that had significant effects in the study year relative to their own rates at baseline. Unfortunately, this approach kept us from associating durability of the effects with a particular intervention, as well as from making site-to-site comparisons. As a result, we were unable to conduct multivariate analyses, although we were able to assess whether improved performance for sites that showed success on certain quality indicators during implementation did persist past the study period. However, finding the right approach to long-term evaluation, given the limits imposed by lack of resources constricting a system's desire to adopt promising interventions, can be a significant barrier to forming valid conclusions about sustainability.\nQuantitative methods, however complex, are best suited for measuring ongoing performance, but evaluating implementation interventions or program\/strategy usage requires methods that yield more texture and detail (i.e., observation and interviews). May and colleagues evaluated the sustainability of telemedicine services in three projects over five years using such qualitative techniques, enabling them to better determine the how and the why of their empirical results [ 14 ]. Similarly, in addition to measuring clinical endpoints, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with two key informants from each of the sites that we felt best characterized a particular type of site from each intervention arm. For example, a site that participated in the study collaborative and the national collaborative was chosen, as well as one that participated in the study collaborative only. Answers to questions regarding the existence of known barriers to reminder use and continuation of collaborative activities enhanced our ability to interpret the quantified results.\nImplementation barriers and facilitators identified during a project's FE also should be taken into account in designing follow-up sustainability analyses. Based on one component of our project's FE regarding the use and usefulness of the reminders [ 45 ], we asked our informants during follow-up if the barriers described in the human factors analysis were subsequently removed and recommendations for procedural modifications heeded. For those sites where barriers had been removed, we were able to conclude that observed performance during the follow-up phase was not a result of the persistence of those barriers.\nHow to get funded\nFinding financial support to conduct an evaluation of sustained effects will more than likely be a high hurdle for the action-oriented implementation researcher, at least within the U.S., since the traditional three-year grant is rapidly giving way to a shorter and leaner version that obviates any follow-up analyses. Justifying the addition of a fallow period after completion of a project would have been difficult before \u2013 and now is virtually impossible without a funded extension. Funded extensions for research grants are rare, although small grants for focused, short-term projects are becoming more common. Such small grants are sufficient to conduct a brief sustainability analysis, as long as the scope is limited and the plan for the evaluation and human subjects' approval is already in place. One caveat for pursuing rapid turnaround grants, such as the one that funded our analysis, is that they may limit the latitude of a qualitative component, in particular, since those analyses are generally more time and resource consuming.\nAnother option is to entrust the measurement to others. There is a role for the implementation researcher in encouraging participating clinical entities to take on the tasks of monitoring and assessing their own performance. For this to happen, the enterprise needs to make sense to them (i.e., information generated should be useful to their decision making). This is different from researchers who monitor and assess for the sake of generating results for, say, disseminating them to a broader scientific audience. Clinicians need to grasp the value of evaluation as part of their usual practice, so that they understand the importance of having data on important aspects of care delivery that serve the purpose of sustaining change.\nSummary\nIn this paper, we have summarized the concept of sustainability by briefly reviewing how it has been characterized by others, as well as what factors may affect it from organizational and behavioral perspectives. We defined sustainability as the continued use of core elements of an intervention and persistent gains in performance as a result of those interventions , which highlights the distinction made between measuring the potential to sustain as part of an implementation project's FE, and measuring whether usage and improved performance persisted after implementation is completed and the project resources are withdrawn. Finally, we made a number of recommendations regarding the design of a sustainability analysis, which are summarized in Table 4 . Table 4 Recommendations for designing a sustainability evaluation WHAT TO MEASURE: \u2022 Don't measure sustainability of interventions that were not useful or didn't achieve a credible level of success. \u2022 Know what particular components of the intervention were actually implemented and\/or adapted, and measure sustainability from both a process and outcome point of view. \u2022 Understand the assignable causes of sustainability failure and success. WHEN TO MEASURE IT: \u2022 Allow enough time for performance to decline to its nadir. \u2022 The longer the follow-up period, the better. HOW TO MEASURE IT: \u2022 Build in a follow-up evaluation into the original analytic plan to avoid later challenges, if possible. \u2022 Use more than one method to triangulate qualitative information with quantitative data information. \u2022 Talk directly to local stakeholders to understand the how and why behind \u2022 performance measurements. \u2022 Beware of drawing inappropriate conclusions (e.g., outcome attribution failure). HOW TO GET FUNDED: \u2022 Build the follow-up period into the original proposal if possible. \u2022 Look for funding opportunities that explicitly include a sustainability component \u2013 either in the primary grant or through an allowable extension. \u2022 For post hoc-designed analyses, look for small, rapid-response grants. \u2022 Begin to routinize follow-up measurement as the responsibility of local stakeholders.\nBefore a clear method for measuring the persistence of change can be derived, we believe that there is a critical need for the following:\n\u2022 A wider use of FE in implementation studies that would better inform measurement of post-implementation sustainability success or failure,\n\u2022 Availability of a wider array of instruments that measure the important components of sustainability, and\n\u2022 Inclusion of follow-up analyses built into an original implementation design as a funding expectation.\nUntil these come about, evaluation of the period after implementation will remain largely relegated to the \"need for further research\" in most project write-ups. Ultimately, a fuller elucidation of whether quality improvements become institutionalized is needed to determine whether subsidizing implementation of QI yields a sufficient return on the funders' investments.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nCB designed and led this supplemental sustainability analysis and was the predominant contributor to this article.

Lennette Edwin H. With the Technical Assistance of Jessie H. Doleman and Shirley Hagens From the Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory, California State Department of Public Health, Berkeley 1 7 1956 104 1 99 120 16 3 1956 Copyright © Copyright, 1956, by The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research New York\nFluid obtained from HeLa cell cultures infected with poliomyelitis viruses served as a complement-fixing antigen. When used in the native state, i.e . untreated in any way, the fluids acted as homotypically specific antigens. When heated, however, the antigenicity was broadened and a high degree of heterotypic reactivity was encountered. Data are presented indicating that the observed group reactivity was apparently based on common antigens shared by the three immunologic types of poliomyelitis virus. This reactivity appeared to be specific for the poliomyelitis viruses. No evidence was obtained in preliminary experiments that heating of the antigens releases a \"soluble\" antigen responsible for the group reactivity."}
