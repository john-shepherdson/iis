Thirty-seven clones were selected, and their transcriptional start-sites were determined. The upstream sequence of these 37 start-sites, and the sequences of seven previously identified promoters were compared. On the basis of sequence conservation and mutational analysis, a consensus sequence CTTGACN<sub>16&#x02013;23</sub>TATNNT was obtained. In this consensus sequence, nine on of twelve bases are identical to the canonical <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter, however the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters only contain 6.4 conserved bases on average. We show that the <italic>R.etli</italic> sigma factor SigA recognizes all <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters studied in this work, and that <italic>E.coli</italic> RpoD is incapable of recognizing them. The comparison of the predicted structure of SigA with the known structure of RpoD indicated that regions 2.4 and 4.2, responsible for promoter recognition, are different only by a single amino acid, whereas the region 1 of SigA contains 72 extra residues, suggesting that the differences contained in this region could be related to the lax promoter recognition of SigA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNA polymerase holoenzyme consists of a core enzyme (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x02032;), and one sigma factor (&#x003c3;) subunit, which directs the core enzyme to specific sites on DNA to initiate transcription. In general, bacteria contain a main or housekeeping sigma factor, also known as sigma-70 (&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>) which controls the expression of most of the genes, in association with the RNApol core (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b1\">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b4\">4</xref>). Sequence alignments of several &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factors from different bacteria reveal four conserved regions (1 to 4), that have been further divided into subregions, involved in different aspects of transcription initiation, including promoter recognition, promoter melting, initiaton of RNA syntesis, abortive initiation and promoter escape (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b5\">5</xref>).</p><p>The &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> subunit of <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> recognizes two types of promoter sequences: the first one, or &#x02018;canonical promoter&#x02019;, consisting of two hexamer sequences [TTGACA] and [TATAAT], centered respectively in the positions &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 relative to the transcription start-site (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref>). A helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif located in the C-terminus of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (subregion 4.2) recognizes the &#x02212;35 box of the promoter, whereas a more centrally located &#x003b1;-helix (subregion 2.4) recognizes the &#x02212;10 box (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b8\">8</xref>). The second one, named &#x02018;extended&#x02212;10 promoter&#x02019; consists of an element [TATAAT] plus 2 nt [TG], located in the &#x02212;15 and &#x02212;14 positions. In this promoter type a &#x02212;35 region or equivalent sequence does not exist. The N-terminal part of the subregion 3.0 (previously named 2.5) from &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is involved in the recognition of the conserved [TG] motif (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b9\">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b11\">11</xref>).</p><p><italic>Rhizobium etli</italic> is a soil &#x003b1;-proteobacterium with the ability to colonize the roots of bean-plants to form nitrogen fixing nodules. The whole genomic sequence of <italic>R.etli</italic> CFN42 was recently concluded [(<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b12\">12</xref>); GeneBank accession no CP000133], and consists of a circular chromosome and six large plasmids, with an average G + C content of 61.5%. <italic>R.etli</italic> contains a large number of sigma factors (one housekeeping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> gene, two copies of <italic>rpoH</italic>, two copies of <italic>rpoN</italic> and 18 genes of the extracitoplasmic factor group), a feature shared with other nitrogen fixing organisms, like <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic>, <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> and <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b4\">4</xref>). The physiological roles and the mechanisms of promoter recognition by these sigma factors remain unknown. Moreover, in these organisms only a few well-characterized promoters are available.</p><p>The <italic>R.etli</italic> housekeeping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> gene (<italic>sigA</italic>) encodes a protein of 685 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 77.18 kDa. The primary structure of SigA is very similar to RpoD (the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor of <italic>E.coli</italic>), especially in regions 2, 3 and 4, however SigA contains an extended region 1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13\">13</xref>).</p><p><italic>S.meliloti</italic>, <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroide</italic>s also have a larger SigA region 1, and most of their &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters that have been characterized are not transcribed by the <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> RNApol <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>, but in contrast, the RNApol of these bacteria can initiate transcription of typical <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13\">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b16\">16</xref>). This observation suggests some differences between the transcriptional machineries of <italic>E.coli</italic> and the &#x003b1;-proteobacteria, perhaps at the level of promoter recognition by the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor.</p><p>The knowledge of the promoter structures and their regulation in a particular organism is the first step towards the molecular understanding of the regulatory networks, an essential prerequisite to develop tools for genetic engineering.</p><p>To analyze the molecular basis of <italic>R.etli</italic> gene expression in this study, we identified, characterized and sequenced active promoters in <italic>R.etli</italic> under exponential growth conditions. A consensus promoter sequence was deduced, and possesses some differences to the promoter consensus recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> in <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic>. We showed that the double helix stability and the stacking energy of the <italic>R.etli</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter regions possess a minimal energy value around &#x02212;10 box, suggesting that despite the differences in their promoter structures, the promoters of both bacteria preserve thermodynamic properties, which favor DNA denaturation and help the transcription initiation. We demonstrated that SigA specifically recognizes the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters studied in this work, but in contrast, the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNApol holoenzyme is incapable of recognizing them. Finally, we propose that <italic>R.etli</italic> contains a less strict &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> that recognizes a lax consensus promoter structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl1\">Table 1</xref>. <italic>E.coli</italic> strains were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) medium. <italic>R.etli</italic> strains were grown at 30&#x000b0;C in PY medium (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b17\">17</xref>) or minimal medium containing 1.2 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.8 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM succinic acid, 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.0005% FeCl<sub>3</sub>, with the pH adjusted to 6.8 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b18\">18</xref>).

Briefly, DNA single chains (scDNA) were synthesized from 5 to 10 mg of total RNA using a gene-specific primer (GUS-LW5, CGATCCAGACTGAATGCCCAC) complementary to the region located in the position 96 to117 from <italic>gusA</italic>, and using a derivative of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MLV RT). After first strand cDNA synthesis, the original mRNA template was removed by treatment with a RNase Mix (mixture of RNase H and RNase T1) and the scDNA was purified using a GlassMax DNA column. A homopolymeric tail was then added to the 3&#x02032; end of the scDNA using Terminal deoxynucleotidil transferase (TdT) and dCTP.

When secondary bands were obtained, an additional PCR was done using an AAP primer and a third antisense primer (GUS-LW2, GCTTGGCGTAATCATGGTCAT), that was complementary to the DNA region located in the position 1 to 21 from <italic>gusA</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequencing</title><p>DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the GUS-LW primers and Big-Dye terminator kit version 3.1 in an automatic 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of promoter mutations</title><p>Mutant versions of the p<italic>hemC</italic> and <italic>lac</italic> promoters were constructed by PCR using oligonucleotides carrying altered versions of the wild-type &#x02212;35, &#x02212;10 and both boxes simultaneously.

The induction in exponential growth phase (OD<sub>540</sub> = 0.4) was obtained by the addition of isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) up to the final concentration 1 mM. Cells were harvested after 4 h of cultivation and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. A total of 10 ml of culture usually yielded 2.5&#x02013;3 mg of protein. Histidine tagged sigma protein was purified using HisTrap Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer, containing 8 M urea and 0.25 mM phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) [1&#x000d7; phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 20 mM imidazole], and incubated 30 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. After sedimentation of cell debris, lyzate was loaded on to Ni-column and equilibrated with a binding buffer. The desired protein was eluted by phosphate buffer, containing 400 mM imidazol, collected in 0.5 ml fractions, and analyzed in 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The applied procedure provides protein of 95% purity. To avoid the influence of six-aminoacide histidine tagg, HisTrap purified protein was treated by thrombin (Thrombin CleanCleave Kit, Sigma) after buffer exchange by dialysis. After the thrombin treatment protein was dialyzed against TGED buffer [10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.6); 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM DTT; 0.1 M NaCl; 5% (v/v) glycerol] and storage buffer [10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.6); 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM DTT; 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.2 M KCl; 50% (v/v) glycerol]. The final concentration of protein was evaluated by method of Bradford (Bio-Rad protein assay kit).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding shift assay</title><p>Linear DNA templates were randomly labeled with [&#x003b1;-P<sup>32</sup>]dCTP in a standard PCR, purified from 3.5% PAGE and used for DNA&#x02013;protein complex formation.

Binary complexes were allowed to preform for 20 min at 30&#x000b0;C, challenged by heparin (200 mg/ml) and immediately loaded on to 3.5% native PAGE, prewarmed up to the same temperature. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and radioautographed.</p></sec><sec><title>Software tools</title><p>Multiple DNA alignments were done using the programs CLUSTALW version 1.8.1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b24\">24</xref>) and MultiAlin version 5.4.1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b25\">25</xref>). Alignments were visually inspected and adapted with respect to the known transcriptional start-sites. Consensus matrices were generated and selected using WCONSENSUS version v5c (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b26\">26</xref>). Briefly, to identify the &#x02212;10 box, the first 20 bp upstream from the transcription start-site (+1) were used. To identify the &#x02212;35 box, the 20 bp upstream to the &#x02212;20 position were used as an input for WCONSENSUS. Algorithms available from server <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/dna\"/> (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b27\">27</xref>) were used to evaluate double helix stability (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b28\">28</xref>) and stacking energy (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b29\">29</xref>). Calculations for each parameter were carried out with a window size of 10 and 20 nt, providing similar results. For each promoter position, the average value was calculated for the whole set of analyzed sequences.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Isolation of <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter sequences</title><p>To determine the general structure of the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters, a random genomic library with an average insert size of 0.5 kb was constructed in the promoter-test vector pBBMCS53 and introduced by conjugation into <italic>R.etli</italic> CFN42. Direct screening on PY plates containing X-Gluc allowed the selection of transconjugants with an active reporter gene (<italic>gusA</italic>), suggesting that the constructs contained <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter regions. The &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity of 100 transconjugans was determined in PY liquid cultures in exponential and stationary phases of growth. Sixty-eight of these clones showed &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity under both conditions, while the remaining 32 transconjugants expressed the reporter gene only in PY plates, and for this reason were not used in further experiments. The ability to express the reporter gene of the 68 strains described above was tested in different conditions: low oxygen (1%), minimal medium (MM) and at different temperatures (30, 42 or &#x02212;10&#x000b0;C). All but three expressed the reporter gene in all conditions, but at different levels, suggesting that the transconjugants carry constructs with constitutive promoters. The DNA sequences of 36 inserts of these constructs were determined. These promoter sequences, plus seven <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters experimentally identified in other studies were selected for subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b30\">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b35\">35</xref>).</p><p>Thirty-three promoters were mapped within intergenic regions; eight within the coding regions of the immediately preceeding gene, and three in DNA sections that contained overlapped coding regions.</p><p>The genetic compartments of the 44 promoters of our collection were next: thirty-nine were located on the chromosome, two on plasmid p42d and one in each of these plasmids: p42b, p42e and p42f.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of transcriptional start-sites</title><p>The transcription start-sites are good reference points to identify the upstream conserved sequence characteristics of the promoters. Thus, the 5&#x02032; ends of the mRNAs synthesized from each of the selected 36 promoter regions selected, were successfully identified by 5&#x02032; RACE using the total RNA isolated from PY cultures in exponential growth conditions of the transconjugants. In general, a single RT&#x02013;PCR product was obtained, but in one clone, two conspicuous amplification products were observed. In this case the bands were independently isolated, cloned and sequenced, showing that these products are transcripts associated to the same gene.</p><p>Thirty-eight of the transcription start-sites (86%) fell within the first 250 bp upstream from coding regions, and four transcription start-sites corresponded to the nucleotide A of the start codon ATG from their respective ORF (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl2\">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of a promoter consensus sequence</title><p>The promoter consensus sequence was derived by aligning 50 bp upstream from the transcription start-site of each promoter region. The identification of &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 boxes was corroborated with the WCONSENSUS program as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1a</xref>, over-represented nucleotides clearly appeared around the &#x02212;35 region and, in a lesser degree, in the &#x02212;10 region. Then, the putative &#x02212;10 consensus box [TATNNT] showed four identical positions to the &#x02212;10 box of the <italic>E.coli</italic> consensus promoter [<underline>TAT</underline>AA<underline>T</underline>] recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor. The 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x02212;10 consensus boxes was positioned from 3 to 10 bp upstream from the transcriptional start-site (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1c</xref>). Six promoter regions (14%) showed the dinucleotide [TG] in positions &#x02212;15 and &#x02212;14, which resembled the structure of the <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x02212;10 extended promoter. The &#x02212;35 box consensus sequence [CTTGAC], is identical in five positions to the equivalent box of the <italic>E.coli</italic> consensus promoter [<underline>TTGAC</underline>A] recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>. The spacing between the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 regions ranges from 16 to 23 bp (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1b</xref>). The promoter sequences contain 6.4 conserved bases on average, of the 12 conforming &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35.</p><p>Suboptimal promoters were identified in 11 of the 44 promoter regions as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1a</xref>, but they were not taken in account to generate the consensus promoter sequence for the following reasons: none of them contained both hexameric boxes recognized by the best statistic parameters of WCONSENSUS. Nevertheless, in six of these promoters the &#x02212;35 box overlapped with one proposed by us. In one case the &#x02212;10 box overlapped the region proposed here. Moreover, some of the suboptimal promoters contained the spacer region two long (up to 27 bp) or to short (11 or 12 bp). In two cases the transcription start-sites were located far of the &#x02212;10 boxes (up to 20 bp).</p><p>The results presented here showed that the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter consensus possesses some similarities with the <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter consensus recognized by the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor, but the variability in the nucleotide frequency in each position of the consensus was greater than that observed in <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Thermodynamic properties of the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter regions</title><p>It was recently demonstrated in several bacteria genomes, that the intergenic regions containing promoters are generally less stable and less flexible than coding regions (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b36\">36</xref>). To determine if these thermodynamic properties are also present in the promoter regions of <italic>R.etli</italic>, the stacking energy and the double helix stability were evaluated in our collection of 44 promoters. For this analysis the sequence of 200 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream from transcription start-site of all members of the promoter collection were taken in account. As an internal control, a set similar in size and length was constructed with the immediately downstream coding region of each member of the promoter collection. The same properties were predicted and contrasted with two <italic>E.coli</italic> equivalent sets: one containing 44 randomly chosen promoter sequences experimentally characterized and putatively recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, and the other of 44 coding region sequences that corresponded to the genes controlled by the selected promoters. As shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2a</xref>, the distribution profiles of double helix stability for coding and no coding regions of <italic>R.etli</italic> were similar, however, a significative local minimum around the &#x02212;10 element was detected in our collection of promoter regions. The average stability of the <italic>E.coli</italic> coding regions was higher than the average stability of their promoter regions, and like <italic>R.etli</italic>, a prominent feature of the promoter regions was a minimum stability around the &#x02212;10 box (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>The stacking energy profiles of <italic>R.etli</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter regions were variable, but with a tendency to low negative values (low stability), nevertheless local minimum values were located around the &#x02212;10 box. In contrast, the stacking energy profiles of <italic>R.etli</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> coding regions were similar: both showed more negative values that corresponded to great stability (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2a</xref> and b). These results suggest that despite the variability in the nucleotide composition of <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters, these regions possess thermodynamic and structural properties similar to the <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Promoter sequence mutagenesis</title><p>To demonstrate that the promoter consensus proposed here is correct, the DNA sequence of three <italic>R.etli</italic> mutant promoters (from <italic>repA</italic>, the antisense RNA gene present in the p42d <italic>repABC</italic> operon and <italic>recA</italic>) with the reduced transcriptional activity previously characterized was located in our alignment.

This promoter possessed five conserved positions from consensus and showed moderate activity. Three mutant derivatives were constructed that deviated the promoter sequence from the consensus. First, the putative &#x02212;35 element was altered, changing sequence [ATTGCG] to [A<underline>AGA</underline>CG] to generate the construct pGUSp<italic>hemC</italic>-35.

Third, the putative wild-type &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 elements were changed at the same time to the sequences indicated before, to generate plasmid pGUSp<italic>hemC</italic>-1035. These constructs were introduced into <italic>R.etli</italic> CFN42, and the &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activities of the transconjugants were determined. As shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>, all mutant constructs showed a low level of &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity, indicating that the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 elements of the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter consensus were correctly identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity of the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters in <italic>E.coli</italic></title><p>As described in the previous section, the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter consensus sequence is more variable than that described for <italic>E.coli</italic>. This observation suggests that the <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is unable to recognize the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters or recognizes them less efficiently. To prove this possibility, the 36 transcriptional fusions of the collection were introduced into the BW21038 (<italic>gusA</italic>) strain, and their &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activities were evaluated in plates supplemented with X-Gluc. In this experiment only three promoters were functional, but showed low &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity. These results suggest that the 33 transcriptional fusions are poorly or unrecognized by the <italic>E.coli</italic> sigma factors. It is possible than the <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is incapable of binding the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters because it is more stringent in its recognition pattern, and imposes a strict functional barrier. If this hypothesis is true, then the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (SigA) activates the transcriptional fusions described above in <italic>E.coli</italic>.

In the promoter consensus sequences of <italic>C.crescentus</italic>, <italic>R.capsulatus</italic> and <italic>R.etli</italic>, the &#x02212;35 boxes are more conserved than the &#x02212;10 boxes (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, the inspection of the all sequences showed that each bacterial species has a consensus sequence, with a different degree of variability. The <italic>R.etli</italic> and <italic>R.capsulatus</italic> promoters contain 6.4 and 5.0 conserved bases on average, respectively, less conserved in comparison with the promoter consensus of <italic>C.crescentus</italic>, that contains 8.0, <italic>E.coli</italic> 7.9 and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> 9.1 conserved nucleotides (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b40\">40</xref>). Finally, the number of conserved nucleotides, especially in the &#x02212;10 box, tends to diminish when genomic G + C content is above 60%. It is worth noting that the <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 boxes are A + T rich and conserve 10 of 12 positions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><italic>R.etli</italic> is a bacterium that inhabits diverse environments and has genome rich in genes related to transcriptional regulation, suggesting that it contains a complex genetic regulation system. To characterize the molecular basis of the transcription, and particulary, what kind of sequences act as promoters in <italic>R.etli</italic>, we identified and characterized a promoter consensus sequence recognized by the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor (SigA) in this paper.</p><p>The <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter consensus sequence [CTTGAC] N<sub>16&#x02013;23</sub> [TATNNT] was deduced from 44 promoter regions. Using site-directed mutagenesis of one representative <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter isolated in this work, and a collection of mutants of three promoter regions described previously, we found that all changes fell within the &#x02212;10 or &#x02212;35 boxes identified in this work, suggesting that the consensus sequence is correct. Moreover, two different lines of evidence indicate that this promoter consensus sequence is recognized by the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>. The first one is that <italic>gusA</italic> fusions containing <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters are not functional in <italic>E.coli</italic>, but all regain their activity when complemented with SigA. Second, SigA is able to bind to the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters but not to their mutant derivatives that partially eliminate the &#x02212;35 or &#x02212;10 boxes.</p><p>The location of the 44 promoter regions in the <italic>R.etli</italic> genome showed that 33 are located within intergenic regions, and that 8 (18%), fall within coding regions. This situation has also been observed in other bacteria, i.e. in <italic>E.coli</italic> 18% of the promoters are within genes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b41\">41</xref>), and around of 20% in <italic>Prochlorococcus marinus</italic> (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b42\">42</xref>).</p><p>Of the promoters 86% analyzed here were located less than 250 bp from the translation start codons of their genes. This property has been widely studied in <italic>E.coli</italic>, where it is known that 90% of the promoters are located less than 250 bp upstream from the gene that they regulate (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b41\">41</xref>).</p><p>Although the <italic>R.etli</italic>, <italic>B.subtilis</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter consensus display a common structure, the <italic>R.etli</italic> consensus sequence contains only 6.4 conserved bases on average, revealing a more variable composition than in the <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> consensus, where 7.9 and 9.1 nt are conserved on average, respectively (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b40\">40</xref>). Additionally, the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter consensus shows that the sequence length between the &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 boxes varies from 16 to 23 nt, nevertheless, 25 of the promoters (56.81%) present a distance of 17 &#x000b1; 1 nt. This variation range is similar to that found in <italic>E.coli</italic> (15 to 21 nt) and in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (14 to 20 nt). The percentage of promoters with 17 &#x000b1; 1 nt in length between the hexameric boxes, is quite low compared to <italic>E.coli</italic> (92%) and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (84.5%) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>). The distance between +1 nt and &#x02212;10 box 3&#x02032; end fluctuates from 3 to 10 bases, as found in <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>). Six promoters (14%) were found with a putative &#x02212;10 extended sequence, and their frequency is lower than those reported for this kind of promoter in <italic>E.coli</italic> (20%) and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (45%) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b43\">43</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b44\">44</xref>).</p><p>A computer analysis of DNA double helix stability and stacking energy showed that the promoter regions presented a minimum value for both parameters around &#x02212;10 box, as found in <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters. Having these results in mind, it is reasonable to conclude that in spite of their sequence heterogeneity, the promoter regions preserve thermodynamic properties which have been selected to favor DNA denaturation and help to start the transcription. Similar conclusions have been drawn for other bacterial promoter regions (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b45\">45</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters tested are not recognized by <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, however, the <italic>E.coli lac</italic> promoter is recognized by <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, suggesting that <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is more promiscuous than <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>.</p><p>The deduced primary structure of SigA is 47% similar to the <italic>E coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, especially in regions 2.4 and 4.2, which are responsible for promoter recognition. The most notable difference between SigA and RpoD is the larger size of region 1 of SigA, which contains 72 extra amino acids. This region could be related to the lax promoter recognition of SigA. Thus, <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> being the strictest factor for promoter recognition, it allows less structural variation, which is reflected in a robust consensus sequence. The opposite case is observed in &#x003b1;-proteobacteria, where the promiscuous &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> allows a larger variation in its promoter structure.</p><p>A promiscuous &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor could be an adaptive advantage for bacteria like the &#x003b1;-proteobacteria that inhabit environments with high biological and enviromental diversity, because they can take the benefits of the genetic information acquired by horizontal transfer in a fast and efficient way, avoiding a barrier that could limit the acquisition of new functions required for the adaptation to new environmental conditions.</p><p>Our comparison of the &#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1; consensus of several bacteria suggests that differences in the genomic G + C content are related to promoter structure: the bacteria with high G + C content tend to be more variable, and to have &#x02212;10 boxes different in sequence to those from bacteria with low G + C content, and vice versa. Previous evidence in other organisms supports this conclusion (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b46\">46</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Marco Z&#x000fa;&#x000f1;iga, Rosa Elena G&#x000f3;mez Barreto, Ismael Hern&#x000e1;ndez, Patricia Bustos, Rosa Isela Santamar&#x000ed;a and Jos&#x000e9; Esp&#x000ed;ritu for their skillful technical support.

This computational holographic microscope weighs less than 145 grams with dimensions smaller than 17&#x000d7;6&#x000d7;5 cm, making it especially suitable for field settings and point-of-care use. In this lensfree imaging design, we merged a colorization algorithm with a source shifting based multi-height pixel super-resolution technique to mitigate &#x02018;rainbow&#x02019; like colour artefacts that are typical in holographic imaging. This image processing scheme is based on transforming the colour components of an RGB image into YUV colour space, which separates colour information from brightness component of an image. The resolution of our super-resolution colour microscope was characterized using a USAF test chart to confirm sub-micron spatial resolution, even for reconstructions that employ multi-height phase recovery to handle dense and connected objects. To further demonstrate the performance of this colour microscope Papanicolaou (Pap) smears were also successfully imaged. This field-portable and wide-field computational colour microscope could be useful for tele-medicine applications in resource poor settings.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>A.

A partially coherent light source, e.g., a light emitting diode (LED) is positioned a few centimetres (&#x0223c; 5&#x02013;7 cm) away from the object plane, and the transmitted light pattern through the object is sampled by the sensor chip <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Greenbaum1\">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Mudanyali3\">[36]</xref>. Consequently, in this on-chip imaging geometry rather than directly acquiring an image of the object, the diffracted light that is transmitted through the specimen interferes with the unperturbed light from the illumination source, forming an in-line hologram on the image sensor plane. As a result of its unit magnification, the imaging FOV is equivalent to the active area of the image sensor chip, which can be as large as e.g., 20&#x02013;30 mm<sup>2</sup> for a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor chip or &#x0003e;10 cm<sup>2</sup> for a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD). Accordingly, the FOV of lensfree on-chip microscopy is significantly wider than the FOV of a lens-based transmission microscope that has a similar resolution level <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Greenbaum1\">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-McLeod1\">[37]</xref>. An additional advantage of these holographic on-chip microscopes is that the recorded image can be digitally focused to different depths, thus allowing screening of large sample volumes <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Su1\">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Su3\">[40]</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, spatial resolution of such lensfree on-chip microscopes is limited by the pixel size of the image sensor chip. To digitally circumvent this limitation, and hence improve the spatial resolution of these computational microscopes, pixel-super resolution techniques can be utilized by source shifting, which creates sub-pixel shifted replicas of the same object hologram on the sensor-array. This pixel super-resolution approach enables us to reduce the effective pixel-size of the image sensor to digitally enhance the numerical aperture (NA) of the imaging system by e.g., 3 fold, regardless of the sensor type that is used, whether it is a CMOS or CCD imager chip <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Greenbaum2\">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Quite interestingly, these features of lensfree on-chip microscopy are bound to further improve as new opto-electronic sensors are created, mostly driven by consumer electronics market, and in particular cellular phones. Smaller pixel opto-electronic chips with more megapixels that are constantly being introduced on cellular phone cameras will continue to improve the performance of lensfree on-chip microscopes by providing better resolution and/or larger FOV, breaking the traditional trade-off between resolution and FOV of conventional lens-based optical microscopy <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Greenbaum1\">[32]</xref>. As a matter of fact, the pixel count of cellular phone cameras over the last decade has been following Moore&#x02019;s Law (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g001\">Fig. 1</xref>), which empirically predicts doubling of the transistor count in Central Processing Units (CPUs) almost every 2 years. Stated differently, since their large-scale introduction in 2002, camera phones have continued to double their megapixel count almost every 2 years, reaching &#x0003e; 40 mega-pixels by the end of 2012. As a direct result of this continued growth, today lensfree imaging can routinely achieve giga-pixel range microscopic phase and amplitude images with an effective NA of e.g., &#x0223c;0.8&#x02013;0.9 across a wide FOV of &#x0003e; 20 mm<sup>2</sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Greenbaum1\">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-McLeod1\">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Greenbaum2\">[41]</xref>.</p><fig id=\"pone-0076475-g001\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1371/journal.pone.0076475.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A different view of Moore&#x02019;s law.</title><p>A comparison of transistor counts in central processing units (CPUs) versus the pixel counts on cellular phone cameras.

Colour information in microscopy is rather significant as it serves as a contrast mechanism; for example colour may be used to differentiate different populations of cells using staining such as Trypan blue which is commonly used as a cell viability stain <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Louis1\">[42]</xref>. In addition to this, colour also has a psychological effect since cytotechnologists, pathologists and physicians are in general trained to observe specimen in colour.</p><p>To address this challenge for holographic on-chip microscopy, here we present a lensfree super-resolution colour microscope design, which is cost-effective and field-portable, weighing &#x0003c; 145 grams with dimensions of &#x0003c; 17&#x000d7;6&#x000d7;5 cm (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g002\">Fig. 2</xref>). In this field-portable colour microscope, we introduce an image processing technique that mitigates &#x02018;rainbow&#x02019; like colour artefacts (see e.g., <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g003\">Fig. 3a</xref>) that are characteristic of digital holography <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Isikman2\">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Toge1\">[47]</xref>.

As a result of this, to achieve sub-micron spatial resolution in colour, there is no need to capture three distinct pixel super-resolved holograms, each with a different illumination colour (i.e., red, green and blue). In fact, it is sufficient to acquire only one pixel super-resolved lensfree image with a single illumination wavelength (e.g., green) which can serve as the Y channel of the colour image, preserving the sub-micron resolution over a large FOV. To obtain the remaining U and V channels of the colour image, since there is no need for pixel super-resolution, three LEDs at red, green and blue wavelengths would be sufficient. To demonstrate the resolution and colour imaging capabilities of this field-portable holographic microscope, we imaged a USAF resolution test chart and colour stained Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, which are widely used for pre-screening of cervical cancer <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Baker1\">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Schiffman1\">[51]</xref>.</p><fig id=\"pone-0076475-g002\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1371/journal.pone.0076475.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A portable lensfree super-resolution colour microscope.</title><p>(a) A photograph of the microscope that weighs &#x0003c; 145 grams.

This field-portable, cost-effective and wide-field colour microscope could be significant especially for tele-pathology and micro-biology applications in resource limited environments and developing countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\" id=\"s2\"><title>Methods</title><sec id=\"s2a\"><title>Field-portable colour microscope design</title><p>Our field-portable microscope (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g002\">Fig. 2</xref>) is designed to enable both pixel super-resolution and colour imaging by separating a set of low-cost LEDs that serve as the illumination source into two groups. The first group of LEDs enables pixel super-resolution imaging based on a shift of the source location; it contains 17 green LEDs that are butt-coupled to multi-mode fibers (each with 0.1 mm core diameter, Thorlabs, AFS-105/125Y). The emission of these green LEDs is also passed through a colour filter after each fiber end (bandwidth &#x0223c; 3 nm, centred around 532 nm, Thorlabs, FL532-3) to achieve the temporal coherence that is required for capturing high NA in-line holograms at the detector plane. To implement pixel-super resolution by source shifting, these green LEDs of the first group are arranged into a line, which is tilted 45 degrees relative to the image sensor edges (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g002\">Fig. 2</xref>.b), such that the acquired lensfree holograms can be sub-pixel shifted along both X and Y directions.</p><p>The second group of LEDs enables the acquisition of lower resolution lensfree colour images, and it is composed of only three LEDs: one blue, one green, and one red, with &#x003bb; &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 470 nm, 527 nm and 625 nm, respectively. The illumination bandwidth of each one of these LEDs is rather broad, e.g., &#x0223c; 45 nm, and since pixel super-resolution is not needed here, we did <italic>not</italic> employ a colour filter for these second group of LEDs. Each LED is still butt-coupled to a multi-mode fiber (0.1 mm core diameter), as illustrated in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g002\">Fig. 2</xref>.c.</p><p>All these 20 LEDs are individually controlled by a micro-controller (Atmel, ATmega8515), which sequentially turns on and off each LED within the array, while the image sensor captures lensfree holograms. The image capture and illumination are controlled in LabVIEW, and consequently the entire imaging process, including auto-exposure, is fully automated and is controlled using a laptop computer with a USB connection to the field-portable microscope.</p><p>The distance between the fibers&#x02019; free ends (which are cleaved) and the object plane is designed to be &#x0223c; 6 cm for two reasons: first, to allow the partially-coherent illumination light to gain sufficient spatial coherence before impinging on the sample plane, and second to ensure that each LED will illuminate the sample with an angle that is less than three degrees compared to the surface normal. This restriction is of paramount importance for pixel-super resolution based microscopy, since it enables capturing the same cross-section of the object in each sub-pixel shifted transmission image.</p><p>The above described multi-source illumination module is then connected to the sample holder and a cost-effective, custom-designed Z-stage (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g002\">Fig. 2</xref>.b). This Z-stage has a coarse axial resolution of &#x0223c; 10&#x02013;15 &#x000b5;m, and it is used to move the CMOS sensor chip (1.67 &#x000b5;m pixel size, 10 mega-pixel, monochrome) up and down compared to the sample plane, which is required for achieving multi-height based phase-recovery. This multi-height phase-recovery process enables imaging of dense and connected samples, such as pathology slides, by iteratively eliminating the twin image noise, which is an artefact of in-line holography. This Z-stage is custom built from a lens-tube (Thorlabs, SM1L03) and a threading adapter (Thorlabs, SM1A10), which is glued to the field-portable microscope enclosure.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2b\"><title>Digital colorization of lensfree holographic images</title><p>To obtain high fidelity colour reproduction of the imaged object, three sequential lensfree holograms are initially acquired, each with a different illumination wavelength: blue, green and red (&#x003bb; &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 470 nm, 527 nm and 625 nm, respectively). Then, the background mean values of these holograms are equalized to digitally compensate for power and fiber coupling efficiency variations between different LEDs in our microscope design. These resulting in-line holograms are then back propagated to the object plane (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g003\">Fig. 3</xref>.a). If these in-line holograms were simply combined into an RGB image <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Isikman2\">[43]</xref>, a &#x02018;rainbow&#x02019; like colour artefact would corrupt the image <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Isikman2\">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Toge1\">[47]</xref>. Therefore, to mitigate this artefact, the lensfree RGB image is initially converted into the YUV colour space using Colorspace Transformations package that is processed in MATLAB. The YUV colour space separates the brightness information (Y channel) from the colour information of the image (U and V channels), and therefore by averaging only the colour components with a rectangular window (&#x0223c; 13 &#x000b5;m edge size), the &#x02018;rainbow&#x02019; like colour artefact of lensfree holographic images can be mitigated (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g003\">Fig. 3</xref>.a). However, the spatial resolution of the resulting image becomes relatively low, and to enhance its resolution, the brightness component (Y channel) is entirely replaced by the pixel super-resolved image of the object (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g003\">Fig. 3</xref>.b), which is obtained by using 17 green LEDs that are butt-coupled to a linear array of multi-mode fiber optic cables, as detailed earlier. The resulting colour image has the brightness component (Y channel) from <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g003\">Fig. 3</xref>.b that is super-resolved, and the colour information (U-V channels) from <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g003\">Fig. 3</xref>.a.</p><p>To further enhance the contrast of important sub-cellular features such as cell nuclei, which are typically absorbing and characterized by low intensity values in their lensfree transmission images, dark areas within the brightness (Y) channel were not coloured. These dark areas of an image were detected by thresholding the super-resolved brightness image. The resulting &#x02018;hybrid&#x02019; YUV image is then converted back to RGB colour space to achieve high fidelity colour representation, as illustrated in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g003\">Fig. 3</xref>.c, which is in very good agreement with a conventional lens-based microscope image of the same sample.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2c\"><title>Source shifting based pixel super-resolution</title><p>Pixel super-resolution is a computational method that synthesizes one high-resolution image from a set of sub-pixel shifted lower resolution images of the same scene/object <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Bishara1\">[53]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Farsiu1\">[58]</xref>. The resulting high-resolution image is effectively equivalent to digitizing the object with a smaller pixel-size sensor. In our field-portable microscope, we shift the light source (LED) location by sequentially illuminating the sample with 17 colour filtered LEDs (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g002\">Fig. 2</xref>.b), each of which is butt-coupled to a multi-mode fiber. The sub-pixel shifts between different holograms are evaluated automatically by implementing an iterative gradient method <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Hardie1\">[55]</xref>. These relative shifts together with the lower resolution raw holograms are then provided as inputs to a least-square optimization problem to estimate a high-resolution (i.e., super-resolved) hologram that is consistent with the lower resolution measured lensfree holograms, while also penalizing for high-frequency components that might arise due to measurement noise.

This iterative phase recovery approach uses few intensity measurements (e.g., 3&#x02013;4), where each measurement is obtained at a different sample to sensor distance (i.e., height). The multi-height phase-recovery approach propagates the super-resolved holograms between different heights, and at each step the algorithm enforces the super-resolved hologram intensity, while keeping the resulting phase from the previous iteration untouched. After several iterations (e.g., 5&#x02013;10) the missing phase is retrieved and the twin image noise is significantly suppressed. In our implementation, to change the distance between the image sensor and the sample planes, a cost-effective and custom-designed Z-stage was used (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g002\">Fig. 2</xref>). In case the sample is too thick to fit into the insertion tray of our microscope, various glass cover slips with different thicknesses can also be placed between the sample and the image sensor to change the sample&#x02019;s height compared to the sensor chip. An auto-focus algorithm was also implemented to automatically estimate the sample to sensor distance for each raw hologram without the need for an independent measurement of the sample height <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Mudanyali1\">[14]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2e\"><title>Hologram reconstruction - focusing back to the object plane</title><p>After the phase recovery steps described earlier, the final holographic reconstruction process includes the multiplication of the complex hologram with a reference wave, which in our imaging geometry can be approximated as a plane wave.

Unlike the brightness channel, where the spatial resolution is determined by the effective pixel size of the image sensor after pixel super-resolution, e.g., &#x02264;500 nm, the colour resolution is determined by the size of the averaging window in the YUV colour space (e.g., &#x0223c; 13 &#x000b5;m), which is used to mitigate the rainbow colour artefacts in reconstructed holographic images. However, in the context of Pap tests or pathology in general, this resolution mismatch between the colour (i.e., UV) and brightness (i.e., Y) channels is irrelevant. Sub-micrometer resolution is required in clinical pathology applications to observe the cells&#x02019; boundaries and nuclei; this information is provided in the brightness channel of our field-portable microscope. On the other hand, the colour information is used as a visual marker to distinguish among different cell types; therefore lower colour resolution requirements are acceptable. Moreover, the physical process of colour staining creates an inherent resolution loss as the dye molecules diffuse inside the stained cell, creating smoothened boundaries. Consequently, the presented microscopic colorization scheme satisfies pathology needs, as it provides accurate colour information that would have been normally concealed by the rainbow artefacts of holographic imaging.</p><p>To validate that our field-portable microscope can satisfy pathology needs, we specifically imaged some abnormal cells in a Pap smear as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g007\">Fig. 7</xref> (marked by white arrows). A professional cytotechnologist confirmed the abnormality of these cells beforehand and the cells were imaged with our field-portable device. Abnormal cells have generally distinct spatial features such as a large nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and/or an irregular cytoplasm shape. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g007\">Figures 7</xref>.a-c illustrate the lensfree colour images obtained by our field-portable microscope using four different sample heights (i.e., 1069 &#x000b5;m, 1117 &#x000b5;m, 1159 &#x000b5;m and 1205 &#x000b5;m).

Typically, the twin image noise is strong when the specimen is spatially dense and connected, and it gets weaker when the specimen is spatially sparse. Therefore, if sub-micron resolution is sufficient for a certain imaging application/need, the number of heights to be used in the multi-height phase-recovery process depends on the spatial density of the sample of interest. For samples that are spatially dense and/or require the investigation of fine features obscured by twin image related artefacts (as in the case of Pap smear samples, see e.g., <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0076475-g005\">Fig. 5</xref>), the multi-height phase-recovery process might require more than two different heights in order to produce acceptable results and effectively eliminate the twin image noise. As a solution to this need, our field-portable colour microscope offers the flexibility to acquire super-resolved holograms at any necessary number of sample heights, thus enabling computational colour imaging of dense and connected specimen. Finally, we should emphasize that using a CMOS imager chip that has an even smaller pixel size (e.g., &#x0223c;1.1 &#x000b5;m) <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-McLeod1\">[37]</xref>, a higher spatial resolution of &#x0223c; 300 nm can also be achieved using the same computational imaging technique <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0076475-Greenbaum2\">[41]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id=\"s5\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrated a field-portable colour microscope that can achieve sub-micron resolution over a wide FOV of e.g., &#x0003e; 21 mm<sup>2</sup>. Given its light weight (&#x0003c; 145 grams) and small dimensions (&#x0003c; 17 cm&#x000d7;6 cm&#x000d7;5 cm), this computational microscope is especially suitable for field use. This microscope&#x02019;s design combines pixel super-resolution and multi-height phase-recovery techniques with a colorization algorithm to significantly reduce &#x02018;rainbow&#x02019; like artefacts observed in colour holographic imaging. To demonstrate the resolution and colour imaging capabilities of this computational microscope, we imaged a resolution test target and stained Pap smear samples. This light-weight, cost-effective and wide-field colour microscope might be rather useful for tele-pathology and micro-biology applications in resource poor settings and developing countries.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id=\"pone.0076475-Wang1\"><label>1</label><mixed-citation

However, any real measurement of long-term effects is rare and sporadic in the burgeoning discipline of healthcare implementation science. Akin to other aspects of healthcare, such as the pharmaceutical industry's post-marketing phase of pharmacovigilance for monitoring ongoing drug quality and safety, more prospective studies that follow implementation program dynamics over the long term are needed. As things stand, very little is known about what eventually happens to outcomes &#x02013; or whether new programs even still exist after implementation is completed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].</p><p>This article is one in a <italic>Series </italic>of articles documenting implementation science frameworks and approaches developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI).

CR facilities received software and technical assistance in implementing real time reminders. GBQI facilities participated in a year-long collaborative emphasizing rapid cycle quality improvement targets of their choice. Ten predefined clinical endpoints included the receipt of highly active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, screening and prophylaxis for opportunistic infection, as well as monitoring of immune function and viral load. Optimal overall care was defined as receiving all care for which the patient was eligible. Interventional effects were estimated using clustered logistic regression, controlling for clinical and facility characteristics. Human subjects' protection approval was obtained.</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Results:</td><td align=\"left\">Compared to controls, CR facilities improved the likelihood of hepatitis A, toxoplasma, and lipid screening. GBQI alone improved the likelihood of pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis, immune-monitoring on ARVs &#x02013; but reduced the likelihood of hepatitis B screening. CR+GBQI facilities improved hepatitis A and toxoplasma screening, as well as immune-monitoring on ARV.

Thus, we evaluated sustained performance as follows: At the facility-rather than the arm-level, we examined raw rates of patients receiving HIVGBC at only those facilities in the intervention arms that had significant effects in the study year to determine whether they continued to show a significant increase in these rates in the following year, compared to their raw rate at baseline. We also conducted a qualitative component. Based on formative evaluation results assessing the use and usefulness of the reminders, we asked informants if identified barriers were subsequently removed and recommendations heeded. Also, we evaluated the extent to which staff members from the sites that participated in the collaboratives were still conducting rapid-cycle improvement methods to address local care quality problems; whether they still maintained the social networks established during the original study, and the degree to which they were used to disseminate subsequent quality improvement change ideas, and shared network contacts with &#x02013; and taught the method to new staff.</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Results:</td><td align=\"left\">For hepatitis A screening, we found that 4 out of the 5 sites that showed a significant increase in their raw rate at 12 months, also showed a significant increase in their raw rate at 24 months compared to baseline (p = .05). For the other four significant indicators of HIVGBC (hepatitis C and toxoplasma screening, CD4/viral load and lipids monitoring), all sites that showed significant increases in their raw performance rates at 12 months, showed a significant increase in their raw rates at 24 months compared to baseline.</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Conclusions:</td><td align=\"left\">Intervention effects were sustained for one year at nearly all the sites that showed significant increases in performance during the study period. Nearly all sites exposed to reminders were using at least some of the 10 available in the follow-up year. Collaborative methods were still being used, but only at the most activated of the original study sites.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>HIV/Hepatitis QUERI Center project</title><p>In a complex and lengthy implementation project, we compared the separate and combined effects of real-time, computerized clinical reminders and group-based quality improvement collaboratives at 16 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare facilities for one year, in order to evaluate each intervention, as well as the interaction of the two, in improving HIV care quality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Then, to ascertain whether performance gains associated with the implemented interventions were sustained and whether or not they had become part of routine care (i.e., had been 'routinized'), we sought guidance from the related literature about how to measure ongoing performance and continued use of the interventions during a follow-up year.</p><p>Questions regarding sustaining QI have been addressed in existing work (e.g., Greenhalgh et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>], Fixsen et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], and &#x000d8;vretveit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]); however, we failed to find enough detail in this literature to actually direct the design and conduct of a sustainability analysis. Therefore, in this article we strive to provide such direction. First, we briefly explore what is known about the lasting effects of quality improvement interventions in regard to long-term behavior change, as well as knowing why gains achieved in performance often fail after implementation. We then provide guidance for implementers interested in measuring not just whether QI changes were likely to sustain, but whether they actually did. We describe important considerations for designing such an analysis, drawing from our own effort, and also framed within the rich theoretical and empirical contributions of others.</p></sec><sec><title>The concept of sustainability</title><p>Simply describing implemented interventions as successes or failures leaves too much room for interpretation: What is 'success?' What is 'failure?' What is the timeline by which such conclusions are drawn?</p><p>A first step to correcting these ambiguities is making a strong distinction between <italic>achieving </italic>improvement in outcomes and <italic>sustaining </italic>them. Achieving improvements generally refers to gains made during the implementation phase of a project that typically provides a generous supply of support for the intervention, in the way of personnel and other resources. However, sustaining improvements refers to \"holding the gains\" [p.7, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]] for a variably defined period after the funding has ceased and project personnel have been withdrawn &#x02013; an expectation identified as a major challenge to the longevity of public health programs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. For this reason, it behooves implementation scientists to keep the longer view in mind when designing interventions, including those that potentially will be exported to other venues.</p><p>To paraphrase Fixsen and colleagues, the goal of sustainability is not only the long-term survival of project-related changes, but also continued effectiveness and capacity to adapt or replace interventions or programs within contexts that constantly change [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. Thus, sustainability also can refer to embedding practices within an organization [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. Failure to do so can be a result of either a poor climate for implementation or poor commitment by users because of a misfit with local values [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p><p>For measurement purposes, this multi-faceted definition needs to be understood and sustainability addressed early in a project. Such an assessment would be unlikely without a proper formative evaluation (FE) built into the original study design [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>], as discussed below. This includes assessment of relapse. Although some degree of backsliding happens in any attempt to change behavior, relapsing to old behaviors should be accounted for [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. From a measurement perspective, a decision has to be made regarding how much relapse can be tolerated and still allow investigators to call the new behavior sustained.</p><p>As the mention of backsliding suggests, sustainability, as we define it, differs from &#x02013; but may depend upon &#x02013; replication when the innovation is expected to spread to additional units or sites within an organization. Similar to fidelity, replication is concerned with how well an innovation stays true to the original validated intervention model after being spread to different cohorts [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. [We use 'validated' not to indicate testing in highly controlled settings, but rather in regard to testing in more typical, real-time circumstances.] Racine argues that sustained effects can be achieved only through the reliable spread of an innovation, or the faithful replication of it [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].</p><p>Slippage of the intervention from the original achievement of change related to its core elements can occur as a result of influences from multiple levels of the organization, due to, for example, local staffing conditions, administrators losing interest, or changes in organizational goals. Slippage can be limited through performance monitoring, standards enforcement, and creating receptive subcultures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], all strategies requiring some degree of infrastructure support. Yet, shortage of such support is precisely why many QI interventions eventually disappear.</p><p>There are four prerequisites for realizing program benefits over time: 1) adequate financial resources, 2) clear responsibility and capacity for maintenance, 3) an intervention that will not overburden the system in maintenance requirements [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], and 4) an intervention that fits the implementing culture and variations of the patient population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Skeptics may argue that these organizational components rarely coincide in the real world. Some see standardizing QI interventions as a pitfall that should be avoided, while some seem less worried about the negative effects of variation because they see it as a necessary adaptation to local environments [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. Preventing adaptation at this level may explain why an intervention did or did not sustain, so imposing fidelity can be a double-edged sword. This can be better understood and clarified by measuring it through both the project's FE and, later, in the follow-up analysis.</p><p>To construct an informative definition of sustainability, it is important to keep in mind the fundamental objective of implementation and QI: To improve patient health. For example, effectiveness measured by number of smoking quits or higher screening rates for at-risk patients are typical of implementation project objectives; actual improvements in morbidity and mortality are the inferred endpoints of interest. The overarching concern of any QI effort should be for an intervention or program that survives long enough to lead to improvements in patient health that can be measured. That being said, establishing the relationship between a particular QI strategy and its related health outcome(s) may be somewhat ambitious considering the barriers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>].</p><p>Following &#x000d8;vretveit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>], we conceptually define sustainability in two ways: 1) continued use of the core elements of the interventions, and 2) persistence of improved performance. Operationally defining and measuring 'continued use,' 'core elements,' 'persistence,' and 'improved performance' was a challenge for us &#x02013; an experience that formed the basis of this article.</p></sec><sec><title>Factors affecting sustainability and its measurement</title><p>Spreading innovations within service organizations can range from \"letting it happen\" to \"making it happen,\" depending on the degree of involvement by stakeholders [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. The former passive mode is unprogrammed, uncertain and unpredictable, whereas, the latter active mode is planned, regulated and managed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].</p><p>Consider the three situations in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>. In each, performance improvements, shown on the vertical axes, decline when the active phase ends although each ultimately represents a different outcome. In the first situation, the active phase shows initial gains (i.e., <italic>sustainability success</italic>) but performance still decays somewhat when support is withdrawn. However, given a sufficiently receptive environment, improvements can remain above the baseline level in the long-term. Alternatively, the second curve shows performance returning to baseline, and in the worst case, dropping below it, indicating <italic>sustainability failure</italic>. Although either the first or second circumstance could result from a situation where support for the intervention is relatively passive, active maintenance may make all the difference in long-term success; and sustainability failure seems particularly likely if the level of support provided for the intervention during implementation is withdrawn after its completion (e.g., enriched clinic staff, research assistants, leadership endorsement).</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Three possible outcomes of performance improvement: Successful, failed, and enhanced.</bold> (T1 = baseline period, T2 = implementation period, T3 = follow-up period).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1748-5908-3-21-1\"/></fig><p>In the final situation, which clearly reflects an active mode, a successfully implemented intervention with follow-up booster activity at certain intervals sustains performance improvements, albeit in a somewhat saw-tooth pattern. Declines are attenuated as a result of the periodic nudge, as without occasional reinforcement or higher order structural changes to encourage institutionalization of the new 'steady state,' the new behavior will eventually decay or revert back to its previous state.</p><p>In identifying a need for a better model of the maintenance process in health behavior change, Orleans argued that more effort should be focused on maintenance promotion rather than on relapse prevention [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. Yet, how much do we really know about what is needed to prevent slips and relapses from occurring until an intervention with its associated performance gains is institutionalized? This question cannot begin to be answered until one knows whether implemented change has actually succeeded or failed in the longer term, and to know that, it has to be measured.</p><p>Being cognizant of models describing human behavior and lifestyle change may benefit the selection of suitable sustainability measures to study the behavior of providers and organizations. Models most frequently used are based on assumptions that people are motivated by reason or logic, albeit within contexts influenced by social norms or beliefs (e.g., Health Beliefs Model [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>] and Theory of Reasoned Action [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>]). However, logic is not always a primary driver of behavior [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] but when it is, the logic may be generated in regard to cultural or structural factors (i.e., peer norms or an individual's relationship with his/her supervisor). Measures that capture information about what drives continued participation in QI efforts would be useful.</p><p>While change through the internalization of new processes is essential for sustaining implementation, one factor that we have observed to be associated with sustainability failure is a lack of systems-thinking. That is, to capitalize on gains made during the active phase, and to design proper sustainability measures, one must view organizations as complex, adaptive systems [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>]. In such systems, processes that promise to be inherently (albeit unintentionally) supportive of the anticipated change can be leveraged with careful planning to both generate and maintain a QI change. Because routinization of innovations drives sustainability, measures should take into consideration the degree to which a given practice has been woven into standard practice at each study site, such as its centrality in the daily process flow and its location in the practice models held and adhered to by personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>] (e.g., the Level of Institutionalization instrument or LoIn [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Measuring sustainability as persistence</title><p>In seeking examples of studies that included any degree of follow-up evaluation, we found that evaluation of health promotion programs, primarily in regard to improving individual behavior, and continued concordance with treatment guidelines after implementation or dissemination, targeting either provider or organizational performance, were the two most common foci. This is similar to what Greenhalgh's group found in searching for reports on diffusion of service innovations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. Overall, however, our impression, like others' [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>], was that reported analyses of sustained effects are rare (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref> for examples from our search).

The fundamental difference between the two is that the former is limited to measuring the likelihood that changes <italic>will sustain</italic>, as the project will end before the maintenance period occurs. There are several measures that could be included in an FE that would elucidate and potentially enhance realization of this concept [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. The latter type of analysis is limited to measuring whether use of the intervention or performance gains <italic>actually did sustain </italic>without an ability to influence the probability of that occurrence. The LoIn instrument [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>] is perhaps the single best example of this latter approach.</p><p>With enough forethought and funding, using both premeditated and post hoc approaches would be optimal. However, without the value of forethought we conducted a post hoc-designed evaluation and, in doing so, realized how uncertain we were about what to measure, when and how to measure it, and how to get funded to do so. What follows is a synthesis of what we learned from our own observations and what useful insights we gleaned from the relevant literature about designing a sustainability analysis of either type.</p></sec><sec><title>What to measure</title><p>The goal of QUERI implementation is to create effective innovations that remain robust and sustainable under a dynamic set of circumstances and thus ensure continued reduction in the gaps between best and current practices associated with patient outcomes. Hence, knowing precisely what has been sustained becomes important from a performance and thus measurement perspective &#x02013; and therein lies the challenge. Relative to long-term effectiveness, what is it about the intervention or program that should survive? And what about the organizational context needs to be understood in order to adequately interpret what the results mean? The following provide one set of dimensions of improvements that can potentially be turned into critical measures of sustainability, depending on whether the analysis is part of a project FE or conducted post hoc. These dimensions include: 1) intervention fit, 2) intervention fidelity, 3) intervention dose, and 4) level of the intervention target.</p><sec><title>Intervention fit</title><p>Effective interventions targeting any level of the organization are not necessarily enduringly useful ones. There is good evidence showing that interventions that are not carefully adapted to the local context will not endure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. Sullivan and colleagues described a 'bottom-up' approach using provider input to design a QI program that increased provider buy-in and, hence, sustainability of the intervention [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. When improvements fail to persist, the researcher's challenge is in drawing the right conclusion about whether the intervention failed because of external influences that occurred after the intervention period, or because it was not considered to be all that useful to the organization in the long-run [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we suspected that sites that were marginally enthusiastic about participating in the modified collaborative may have felt obliged to participate for the sake of the project, but in actuality, failed to perceive any benefit for the long-term. Modest enthusiasm most likely explains some of the poor performance observed. Collaborative participation, as part of our strategy for continuous quality improvement (CQI), could not &#x02013; and did not for some in our project &#x02013; work with such an attenuated level of interest. More diagnostic FE [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] might have enhanced our intervention mapping to identify and address this issue early on. ('Intervention mapping' is a borrowed term that describes the development of health promotion interventions and refers to a nonlinear, recursive path from recognition of a problem or gap to the identification of a solution [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>Implemented interventions generally consist of multiple components, some of which do not demonstrate success. Solberg et al. found that bundling guidelines into a single clinical recommendation is more acceptable to the providers who are meant to follow them [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. However, in the reminder study arm, we implemented a clinical reminder package that consisted of automated provider alerts for 10 separate aspects of evidence-based HIV treatment. Despite the incomplete success of the full software package (i.e., all the alerts in the package did not generate improvements) it was rolled out intact based on a policy decision. Since sustainability was not an issue for the reminders in the package that had failed to produce significant performance improvements during the project, we simply did not analyze their individual effects in the quantitative aspect of the follow-up sustainability assessment. During interviews with key site-based informants after the study was completed, we learned that some of the implemented reminders were not regarded as helpful by local clinicians in making treatment decisions, which helped us explain their failure to produce significant improvements. In more complex, multi-faceted QI interventions, components should not be so inextricably linked, so that independent evaluation of successful ones is still possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention fidelity</title><p>Because of the general complexity of implementation interventions, it is important to evaluate the discrepancy between what the intervention was like in the original implementation versus what it becomes when sustainability is subsequently measured. Inability to unequivocally credit improvements to a particular intervention within a complex improvement strategy is a common shortcoming of QI research [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. 'Outcome attribution failure' can be a major, and sometimes insoluble, problem in this type of analysis, making it imperative to fully grasp how an intervention morphs with each new implementation unit, at each new site or new phase of roll-out. Wheeler [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] recalls the contributions of Shewhart's 1931 report on controlling variation in product quality in the manufacturing industry. An important message from his work is that normal variations should be differentiated from those that have 'assignable causes,' which create important but undesirable changes in the product over time.</p><p>Although all components of the reminder package were offered to all VA sites after our project's completion, we made no attempt to control local drift in the software or its usage. This could have clouded interpretation of performance in the sustainability period, if we had not interviewed key informants about which specific reminders were still being used and under what circumstances. While quantifying the amount of drift in the way that the reminders were being used would have been preferable, we were at least able to describe variation that occurred based on local need or preference.</p><p>The QUERI framework recommends enhancing and sustaining uptake with ongoing or periodic monitoring at the local level to lower the fidelity gap, because rarely is the first iteration of an intervention perfect. Local adaptations/variations are not, within the caveat of staying true to the actual basis of the targeted best practice, anathema to the four-phased QUERI model, especially if they are designed on an appropriate rationale to actually improve goal achievement. However, it is clear that changing circumstances within the organizational environment can be a significant threat to sustainability. Implementation researchers could use more guidance about how to distinguish between the core features of an intervention that should not be allowed to drift, and those features that can be adapted. In any event, understanding how an innovation may have been adapted over time, or why it was discontinued are both important to assess when trying to determine the black box of implementation and its ongoing effects, especially during the early stages of a phased roll-out when refinements can, and should, be made. Therefore, understanding and implementing desirable changes to an intervention should be part of the overall implementation strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention dose</title><p>The longevity of an adopted intervention may be a direct function of original implementation intensity. The twin concepts of 'dose delivered' and 'dose received', referring to the amount of exposure to and uptake of an implementation intervention [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>], provide a focus for related measurement, although only the latter is important to a post hoc-designed analysis. To measure the dose received in a post hoc analysis, a researcher would ask what proportion of the intervention was still being used by the intended targets. After we implemented the study collaborative in our project, a national VA HIV collaborative was conducted during the follow-up year. Based on key informant interviews, sites in the study collaborative that subsequently participated in the national collaborative seemed more enthusiastic about continuing to use collaborative strategies for continuous quality improvement. For example, in terms of the use of social networks for sharing QI information and usage of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to address new quality problems. We saw this as a clear indication of dose response, which makes a case for incorporating measurement of any booster activity, either prospectively as part of the project's FE, or retrospectively as part of the sustainability analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention target</title><p>Measuring sustainability depends on the change that is targeted and whether the focus of the intervention is the individual (i.e., provider or patient) or the organization (i.e., facility or integrated healthcare system), or both. Implementing change at one level while taking into consideration the context of the others (e.g., individual versus group, facility, or system), will produce the most long-lasting impact [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Effecting changes in individual versus organizational performance are qualitatively different tasks that require not only different instruments for measuring changes, but acquisition of in-depth knowledge of the processes that control adoption or assimilation of the innovation at either level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. Activities associated with the project's FE, such as assessment of facilitators and barriers, will facilitate this latter aspect.</p><p>Our implementation targets were individual providers who operate within the small HIV clinic environment at each VA medical center. However, buy-in and support from clinic leadership was an obvious factor impacting implementation effectiveness of both system interventions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Our sustainability analysis did not include a repeat of this assessment, but, in hindsight, its inclusion would have facilitated our interpretation of performance and usage in our follow-up. Just as targeting levels of individual and organizational behavior provide an important framework to maximize success of implementation efforts, being mindful of what happens at multiple levels after the project also applies to measuring success of sustained QI.</p><p>Sustainability measurement should flow logically from and within the overall project evaluation, thus highlighting the limitations of our post hoc type of approach. However, measuring some of these critical dimensions as part of the project's FE will go a long way toward explaining why an intervention failed or succeeded in the long-run.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>When to measure</title><p>The amount of time that is necessary to follow intervention effects and/or usage is quite variable. In the examples listed in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>, evaluations lasted anywhere from several months after implementation to several years. Ideally, one would keep measuring performance &#x02013; and contextual events &#x02013; until decline shows some indication of stabilizing or the intervention is no longer useful. Some may argue that the more astute investigator will specify the length of the follow-up period based on a theoretical perspective because then, if the follow-up plan becomes altered, they can at least appeal to theory to assess confidence in their results. Because we were limited by funding in our own analysis, the follow-up period was artificially restricted to one year past the end of active implementation. Another difficulty in timing sustainability measurement, described by Titler [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], is knowing where to draw the line between the implementation and follow-up periods. Distinguishing between lingering improvements from the implementation and true persistence of effects from institutionalization also is a challenge [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>].</p><p>In our post hoc analysis, we examined rates of indicated care received by eligible patients at sites within each intervention arm that yielded a significant performance gain during the study year, in order to determine whether that gain persisted in the following year. Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref> shows actual performance measurements from our study for appropriate hepatitis A screening in patients with HIV in three time periods: 1) 12 months prior to launch, 2) during the year-long implementation, and 3) during 12 months of follow-up. Judging from the downward trends in screening performance, we probably did not capture the performance nadir, so one year was probably not enough. Our decision to use a one-year follow-up was admittedly arbitrary and based somewhat on symmetry, given that the two earlier periods also were that length. Ideally, the evaluation period should be long enough to capture the lowest level to which performance will naturally decline, either with or without booster efforts to determine success or failure.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Site-level performance for hepatitis A screening in HIV patients before, during and after a one-year-implementation trial.</bold> Indicated by letter and number, sites implemented either clinical reminders (R), collaboratives (C), or both (C+R).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1748-5908-3-21-2\"/></fig><p>The amount of time it takes to measure long-term effects is dependent on the speed of spread [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. QUERI researchers are not always actively involved in exporting successful QI strategies to other parts of the VA system, thereby making it difficult to know the level of penetration when follow-up evaluation is conducted. Yet due to our close collaboration with the VA central office responsible for HIV care delivery, we did have access to information regarding the level of penetration of our study interventions. Knowing what was happening in the field enabled us to gauge the effects of external events, such as the timing in regard to readiness for subsequent exportation of the reminder software, as well as the schedule for the national collaborative. Then again, there is the temptation for some to use unanticipated external events to excuse a failed intervention. Sustainable QI should be robust to these influences.</p><p>CQI methodology dictates that internal follow-up measurement is needed as long as the intervention or program remains useful to the organization [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>]. Adding to that, our recommendation for estimating how long to follow performance after implementation would be that 'longer is always better,' although what is feasible rightfully tends to override any other consideration. In translating tenets of CQI to the four-phased QUERI implementation model described in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>, the principle remains the same. However, the responsibility for follow-up changes at each phase, such that a move toward creating routine national performance measures should be considered at national roll-out.</p></sec><sec><title>How to measure</title><p>Methods used in evaluating the success of implemented QI interventions and strategies are 'messy' at best, and measuring their longer-term effects is no different. A number of designs have been recommended. Focused audit studies have a built-in cycle for monitoring QI impact against accepted and expected standards over time [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. Other approaches include single case studies and quasi-experimental pre/post-test comparisons [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. We used the latter design to evaluate the implementation of the clinical reminders and collaborative, although this type of design presented our major challenge in evaluating intervention sustainability for two reasons. First, the non-intervention sites became contaminated after the initial study period because they were allowed to adopt the reminders and participate in the national collaborative, thus preventing any further utility as a comparison group. Second, this snapshot-type of approach prevented a more finely grained examination of when the level of decay might have warranted booster treatments.</p><p>Although the lack of an effective control group was not a problem that we could remedy, a more robust approach would have been to use a time-series design [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Ideally, the analytic window would have included monthly measurements over the entire 24-month period, while restricting spread of the interventions to the control sites during that time. In hindsight, multiple measurements during the follow-up phase at the very least would have allowed us to take advantage of this potentially useful information.</p><p>Because our follow-up analysis was not included as a component of the original design, our default post hoc strategy was to compare rates of patients receiving evidence-based HIV care at only those facilities in the intervention arms that had significant effects in the study year relative to their own rates at baseline. Unfortunately, this approach kept us from associating durability of the effects with a particular intervention, as well as from making site-to-site comparisons. As a result, we were unable to conduct multivariate analyses, although we were able to assess whether improved performance for sites that showed success on certain quality indicators during implementation did persist past the study period. However, finding the right approach to long-term evaluation, given the limits imposed by lack of resources constricting a system's desire to adopt promising interventions, can be a significant barrier to forming valid conclusions about sustainability.</p><p>Quantitative methods, however complex, are best suited for measuring ongoing performance, but evaluating implementation interventions or program/strategy usage requires methods that yield more texture and detail (i.e., observation and interviews). May and colleagues evaluated the sustainability of telemedicine services in three projects over five years using such qualitative techniques, enabling them to better determine the how and the why of their empirical results [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. Similarly, in addition to measuring clinical endpoints, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with two key informants from each of the sites that we felt best characterized a particular type of site from each intervention arm. For example, a site that participated in the study collaborative and the national collaborative was chosen, as well as one that participated in the study collaborative only. Answers to questions regarding the existence of known barriers to reminder use and continuation of collaborative activities enhanced our ability to interpret the quantified results.</p><p>Implementation barriers and facilitators identified during a project's FE also should be taken into account in designing follow-up sustainability analyses. Based on one component of our project's FE regarding the use and usefulness of the reminders [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>], we asked our informants during follow-up if the barriers described in the human factors analysis were subsequently removed and recommendations for procedural modifications heeded. For those sites where barriers had been removed, we were able to conclude that observed performance during the follow-up phase was not a result of the persistence of those barriers.</p></sec><sec><title>How to get funded</title><p>Finding financial support to conduct an evaluation of sustained effects will more than likely be a high hurdle for the action-oriented implementation researcher, at least within the U.S., since the traditional three-year grant is rapidly giving way to a shorter and leaner version that obviates any follow-up analyses. Justifying the addition of a fallow period after completion of a project would have been difficult before &#x02013; and now is virtually impossible without a funded extension. Funded extensions for research grants are rare, although small grants for focused, short-term projects are becoming more common. Such small grants are sufficient to conduct a brief sustainability analysis, as long as the scope is limited and the plan for the evaluation and human subjects' approval is already in place. One caveat for pursuing rapid turnaround grants, such as the one that funded our analysis, is that they may limit the latitude of a qualitative component, in particular, since those analyses are generally more time and resource consuming.</p><p>Another option is to entrust the measurement to others. There is a role for the implementation researcher in encouraging participating clinical entities to take on the tasks of monitoring and assessing their own performance. For this to happen, the enterprise needs to make sense to them (i.e., information generated should be useful to their decision making). This is different from researchers who monitor and assess for the sake of generating results for, say, disseminating them to a broader scientific audience. Clinicians need to grasp the value of evaluation as part of their usual practice, so that they understand the importance of having data on important aspects of care delivery that serve the purpose of sustaining change.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>In this paper, we have summarized the concept of sustainability by briefly reviewing how it has been characterized by others, as well as what factors may affect it from organizational and behavioral perspectives.

When used in the native state, <italic>i.e</italic>. untreated in any way, the fluids acted as homotypically specific antigens. When heated, however, the antigenicity was broadened and a high degree of heterotypic reactivity was encountered. Data are presented indicating that the observed group reactivity was apparently based on common antigens shared by the three immunologic types of poliomyelitis virus. This reactivity appeared to be specific for the poliomyelitis viruses. No evidence was obtained in preliminary experiments that heating of the antigens releases a \"soluble\" antigen responsible for the group reactivity. </p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>", "id": "50|od_______908::5344c43d74610711e66400d7a0f5c671"}
