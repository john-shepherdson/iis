Abstract: Numerous examples of closed-cage nanostructures, such as nested fullerene-like
nanoparticles and nanotubes, formed by the folding of materials with layered structure are
known. These compounds include WS2, NiCl2, CdCl2, Cs2O, and recently V2O5. Layered
materials, whose chemical bonds are highly ionic in character, possess relatively stiff layers,
which cannot be evenly folded. Thus, stress-relief generally results in faceted nanostructures
seamed by edge-defects. V2O5, is a metal oxide compound with a layered structure. The study
of the seams in nearly perfect inorganic \"fullerene-like\" hollow V2O5 nanoparticles (NIFV2O5)
synthesized by pulsed laser ablation (PLA), is discussed in the present work. The
relation between the formation mechanism and the seams between facets is examined. The
formation mechanism of the NIF-V2O5 is discussed in comparison to fullerene-like structures
of other layered materials, like IF structures of MoS2, CdCl2, and Cs2O. The criteria for the
perfect seaming of such hollow closed structures are highlighted.

1. Introduction
Nano-scale dimensions in various structures, such as nano-particles, -platelets and -tubes, are
known to result in strongly size-dependant properties, deviating significantly from those of the bulk
materials [1,2]. Materials with a 2-D layered structure generally exhibit the propensity to form closedcage
hollow nanostructures, at times with very different properties as opposed to nano-platelets or bulk
materials [3]. The formation of such closed-cage nanostructures is driven by the energy gained from
exposing their low energy surface to the environment and elimination of dangling bonds. This
energetic gain compensates for the strain energy inherent to the distortion of the layered structure [4].
Hollow, 1-D nano-tubes (NTs) require folding of the nano-platelets along one axis only. However,
folding in two axes is required to create a zero dimensional (0-D) quasi-spherical structure from the
nano-platelets. The strain induced by the folding can be alleviated by the insertion of new topological
elements or defects. For example, carbon fullerenes are formed by the insertion of 12 pentagons into
the hexagonal graphitic layer, or the introduction of six rhombi into the hexagonal MoS2 lattice to
create nanooctahedra [5]. Additional examples include nested closed-cage nano-particles (NP) of WS2
and MoS2 [1,3]. Here, apex- and edge-defects are required to relieve the stress allowing the formation
of quasi-spherical NP, denoted as inorganic fullerene-like (IF). Numerous examples of IF are to be
found amongst the metal- dichalcogenides; dihalides, oxides and other layered compounds [1,2].
Unlike the mono-atomic carbon sheets of graphite, inorganic layered compounds form complex 2-D
layers. Therefore folding into inorganic nanotubes (INTs) and particularly IF structures is notably
more demanding in terms of the elastic energy. In contrast to carbon fullerenes and carbon nanotubes,
which can easily form single wall nanoparticles, typical IF and INT species usually appear as
multiwall structures. Furthermore, inorganic hollow closed nanoparticles possess larger diameters than
their carbon analogues. Here the van der Walls energy of the stacked layers and the large diameter
compensate for the excessive elastic strain of the closed-cage inorganic nanostructures. Overall, the
elastic strain involved in forming 1-D carbon or INT is smaller than that for the respective 0-D carbon
fullerenes or IF structures with the same diameter. This is manifested also through the smaller number
of defects in 1-D nanotubes as compared to IF nanostructures which are rarely totally free of defects.
Compounds whose bonds have a strong covalent character, such as MoS2, are relatively flexible,
enabling even bending of the layers. This is generally not the case for layered compounds with more
ionic character, like metal halides and oxides. As a result, hollow closed-cage structures are composed
of facets [6-8] seamed by edge-defects and new topological elements in the apex. Thus, synthesis of
closed-cage NPs and NTs from layered metal oxides, such as NT-VOx, often presents many
challenges [2,7]. Additionally, the increased ionicity and charge transfer between individual atoms
increase the electrostatic forces between the layers. Closed layered structure dictates an increasing
number of atoms in each layer. In order to maintain the inter-layer distance shearing the 2-D layers
with respect to each other is required, which is nevertheless inhibited by the increased ionicity.
Materials 2010, 3
4430
Furthermore, formation of apex defects, which enable folding and closing of the layer into a hollow
closed cage (fullerene-like), are challenging in materials with highly complex unit cells, like (2-D)
metal oxides. For example the number of atoms in the unit cell of V2O5 is 14 (as compared to 2 for
graphite and 6 for MoS2), which suggests a larger variety of possible structural combinations. The
synthetic obstacles are further compounded by the issue of stability. Metal oxides are sensitive to the
surrounding conditions [7] as they are prone to reduction, e.g. by the electron beam, and tend to lose
oxygen upon heating [9]. Additionally, water molecules from the humid ambient can be easily
adsorbed to the polar metal-oxide bond. The last issue is very acute where facets are not seamed
properly allowing easier penetration of water molecules [7].
The rich vanadium-oxygen phase diagram is the result of the large number of vanadium valence
states. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is the most stable member in the vanadium oxide family [10] and is
one of the few metal oxides with versatile redox-dependant properties [11]. Thus it finds numerous
applications in catalysis [12,13], ceramics [14], solar cells [15], chemical sensors [16], electrical and
optical devices [17,18], infra-red detectors [19] and as a cathode material in rechargeable lithium
batteries [20]. Indeed, rechargeable Li-intercalated V2O5 electrodes were extensively investigated due
to their long service life, high energy and power densities, as well as the abundance and low price of
V2O5 [11]. The catalytic activity is the result of easy reduction and oxidation between the multiple
oxidation states of the vanadium oxides [12]. V2O5 exhibits photo- and electro-chromic behavior and
therefore is used in information displays and color memory devices [17]. V2O5 has been intensely
studied as a functional ceramics [14].
V2O5 crystallizes in two similar layered structures at ambient conditions. α-V2O5 (Figure 1a) is the
stable and prevalent structure while γ-V2O5 (Figure 1b) is obtained by de-intercalation of Li+ ions from
γ-LiV2O5 bronze. γ-V2O5 is meta-stable at ambient conditions and exhibits a sharp transition to α at
340 °C [21]. Rapid quenching (>106 K·s-1) of liquid V2O5 (mp = 680 °C [22]) leads to the formation of
amorphous V2O5 [23]. A rapid crystallization of the amorphous phase to α-V2O5 is observed at
200 °C [23]. Heating in reducing or oxygen deficient environments results in oxygen loss from
the V2O5 [24].

vdW gap.

Both phases of V2O5 phase possess an orthorhombic structure and are composed of alternating
distorted VO5 square pyramids, creating double layers of O-V-O [20]. These layers are separated by a
van der Waals (vdW) gap (the black arrows in Figure 1). Therefore, V2O5 exhibits strong anisotropic
characteristics [20,26] typical to 2-D layered materials. The (010) plane also known as the basal (vdW
plane) exhibits a lower surface energy as compared to the (100) and (001) planes. Unlike the
metal-dichalcogenides where the c axis denoted the basal plane, the b axis is often used to define the
vdW gap for metal-oxides with layered structures. As a result of the weak inter-layer force, the vdW
gap (4.4 Å) provides a large number of intercalation sites. This enables intercalation of lithium
ions [27] or water [28], resulting in an expansion of the lattice parameters especially along the b axis
(the vdW gap). The layered structure of γ-V2O5 resembles closely that of α-V2O5. As a result the
γ-V2O5 unit cell may be obtained from that of α-V2O5 by a few rearrangements and twists [29]. These
twists make the γ-V2O5 layers more flexible but also render the structure meta-stable.
Numerous V2O5 nanostructures have been reported, including composite alkyl-amine-VOx NT and
nanoscrolls [30], nanowires [31], nanoribbons [10,32], nanorods [10,18,33-35], nanoneedles [11,36],
nanoplatelets [36] and NP [11,12,15,16,36,37]. Micro-scale structures such as hollow microspheres
composed of nanorods [38] and microtubes [39] were reported as well. Accordingly, a large variety of
chemical and physical methods have been used for the preparation of V2O5 nanostructures. Among them
are dry processes such as flame spray- and oxidative pyrolisis [11,14], thermal treatment [15,18],
microwave plasma torch [36], laser pyrolysis [37], laser-assisted metal oxidation [39], and wet
processes such as the aforementioned templating methods [12,33,35], chemical synthesis [31],
electrochemical deposition [11,14], self-assembly [38], and sol-gel synthesis [40]. Of note is pulsed
laser ablation (PLA) which has been used extensively in deposition of oriented layers of V2O5 [16-18]
and synthesis of a various nanostructures [20,41,42].
Of particular interest for a number of reasons are the composite alkylamine-VOx nanotubes
(NT-VOx) [30]. Attaching the self-assembling alkylamine molecules to the V2O5 backbone provides a
measure of flexibility, thus allowing folding under the mild conditions (T = 180 °C) used in
hydrothermal synthesis. Despite the great promise of NT-VOx, the main obstacle is the large degree of
NT disorder adversely affecting their mechanical and electrical behavior. Attempts to remove the
alkyl-amine molecules met partial success and ultimately destroy the NT-VOx [30]. Although pure
NT-V2O5 were the subject of quantum-mechanical calculations [43] no perfect V2O5 closed-cage
nanostructures have been reported to date. The synthesis of nearly perfect IF-V2O5 termed NIF [29] by
pulsed laser ablation has been recently reported.
The PLA process entails the ablation of a solid target by the laser beam. The recoil from the laser
beam results in a plume which may consist of various species such as plasma, vapors, liquid droplets
and solid particles [44,45]. The high temperature of the plume with respect to the ambient
(~2,000 °C [41]) results in a rapid non-equilibrium quenching (>109 K·s-1). Thus nanostructures with
high internal energy [42] may form. Allowing the ablated plume an additional short heating process in
an oven was shown to provide effective relaxation (annealing) of the nanostructures possibly to their
respective lowest energy configuration [42].
This work studies the underlying principles behind the imperfect nature of the NIF-V2O5 by
focusing on the defective domains seaming the facets. These domains are examined by TEM and in
light of additional understandings regarding the growth kinetics involved in the formation mechanism.

The nature and stability of the NIF-V2O5 structures are studied through post reaction treatments. The
NIF-V2O5 and NT-VOx are compared to IF and INT of other materials with layered structures. It is
concluded that the high structural complexity of the V2O5 unit cell is the deciding factor in the
appearance of the imperfect seams in the NIF-V2O5 and thus can be used as a guideline for the study of
future IF. Furthermore, the complex interplay between lattice structure and topological factors
influencing the formation mechanism of hollow closed-cage structures is discussed.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. NIF-V2O5 characteristics and formation mechanism
NIF-V2O5 NPs were synthesized by pulsed laser ablation (PLA) as previously described in [29]. A
schematic of the PLA process is shown in Figure 2. Here a pulsed laser beam hits a solid target,
thereby ablating it. The recoil from the laser beam creates a plume. This plume may then consist of
plasma, vapors, liquid droplets and solid nanoparticles. The temperature of the plume may be in excess
of 2,000 °C [41]. This plume then undergoes rapid quenching (>109 K·s-1) due to the large temperature
gradient with respect to the furnace temperature. The violent and rapid nature of this process, which is
far from equilibrium, leads to the formation of nanostructures with high internal energy. This plume is
then deflected by the carrier gas and the quenched products are deposited on a cooled collection plate.
As the plume is deflected it undergoes a short annealing process in the furnace. As seen in Figure 3 the
NIF-V2O5 NP are relatively well dispersed and quite disjoint from each other.
The solid target may be replaced by a carrier (liquid or solid) matrix in order to prevent aggregation
of the nanoparticles [46]. However this usually results in heavy contamination from the matrix (such as
carbon in the case of a polymer matrix) or the solvent and does not always result in improved
dispersion or yield. In the case of NIF-V2O5 NP maintaining an oxidizing environment is desirable in
order to prevent reduction of the V2O5 [12,24]. Using a carrier matrix could reduce the amount of
oxygen available to the NIF-V2O5 NP.

Typical quasi-spherical, hollow NIF-V2O5 are produced at a furnace temperature (Figure 2-No.5)
of 300 °C as seen in scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively)
images (Figure 3a and 3b, respectively). The typical size of the NIF-V2O5 ranged from 40 to 70 nm in
Materials 2010, 3

diameter. A close-up view of one such NIF-V2O5 (Figure 3c) reveals a hollow NP with numerous
facets typically imaged as made of concentric layers nested within each other, parallel to the outer
surface, with the vdW distance (4.4 Å) separating them (Figure 3d). Furthermore, looking at areas
between facets one can see that adjacent facets seem to be connected by a short defective domain
(dotted frame in Figure 3d) while non-adjacent facets seem to be connected by large amorphouslooking
sections (dashed frame in Figure 3d).

The proposed formation mechanism [29] is schematically described in Figure 4. This process was
assumed to take place in three steps. In the first step molten liquid droplets of V2O5 are formed in the
hot recoiling plume (up to 2,000 °C [41]). These droplets are rapidly quenched to form amorphous
V2O5 NP (mp = 680 °C [22]). Finally, the NP undergoes crystallization from the surface inwards at
multiple locations, creating multiple facets. This step leaves a hollow core, since the crystalline
phase [47] is denser than the amorphous phase as described by Hevesi [48], Livage [49] and their
co-workers, thus creating the NIF-V2O5. The convergence of crystallizing facets creates defective
domains between adjacent facets.

nanoparticle with individual facets growing laterally and radially (d) Fully crystalline NIFV2O5
NP with defective domains between facets.
The proposed mechanism indicates that the NIF-V2O5 should be almost completely crystalline.
Indeed, tilting the TEM grid along with the NIF-V2O5 reveals unseen facets (Figure 5) not observed at
the original position, thus suggesting that the amorphous-looking sections are in fact crystalline facets
which are not in edge-on position with respect to the TEM electron beam. However, short defective
domains between adjacent facets are still observed (Figure 5f).
While the growth mechanism of IF-WS2 is readily investigated due to the long growth period
(several hours), the growth mechanism of the NIF-V2O5 occurs within a matter of seconds thus
requiring other methods such as in-situ optical monitoring.
Furthermore, the proposed growth mechanism of NIF-V2O5 NP is in stark contrast to that of
IF-WS2. The synthesis of IF-WS2 from oxide nanoparticles was shown to go through a slow diffusion
controlled reaction, where sulfur diffuses in replacing the oxygen in the core. Here the few outer
complete tungsten disulfide layers (which form in a matter of seconds) serve as a barrier to sulfur (in)
and oxygen (out) diffusion. This leads to slowing down of the reaction rate allowing the inner WS2
layers to grow in the energetically most favorable configuration, i.e., as a single growth front along the
edges of the single 2-D layer [50]. Thus the rate at which a single layer grows is much larger than the
rate of the formation of the next layer (layer by layer growth). These growth rates may be defined as
lateral growth where a layer grows sideways and radial growth (inwards) where the next layer
is formed.

close-up (d,e,f). The blue dashed frame highlights fringes which appear at specific tilt
angles. The spacing corresponds to that of the vdW gap (4.4 Å).
In the case of NIF-V2O5 the growth mechanism can be described as a kinetically controlled (fast)
nucleation and growth. The large number of facets indicates the existence of multiple growth fronts.
Therefore the ratio between the lateral and radial growth rates plays an important role in the final
morphology. The typical NIF-V2O5 produced at 300 °C exhibit a ratio between the length of the facets
(number of layers) and their width (the size of each individual layer) generally between 1:1 to 4:1.
This indicates that the radial growth rate of the facet is larger than the lateral growth rate. It is assumed
that this discrepancy occurs due to the corrugated shape of the V2O5 layers (Figure 1a) which may act
as a template for subsequent layers resulting in a faster crystallization rate along the b axis.
At a lower furnace temperature of 50 °C only small compact (non-hollow) crystalline V2O5 NPs are
observed (Figure 6a) and occasionally rearrange as polycrystalline clusters reminiscent of an NIFV2O5
(Figure 6b). On the other hand at a higher temperature of 340 °C fewer NIF-V2O5 are observed
and these are composed of longer facets with sharper angles between them (Figure 6c) as compared to
the NIF-V2O5 produced at 300 °C (Figure 3c).
The products of PLA at 50 °C strongly suggest that the short defective domains are the main reason
for these morphological changes. It is assumed that at 50 °C there is not sufficient energy to stabilize
the defective domains between crystallizing facets, which are formed during the last step of the
formation of the NIF vanadia nanoparticles. It has been previously suggested that the short defective
domains observed at 300 °C are composed of γ-V2O5 allowing seaming of α-V2O5 facets together [29].
This suggestion is supported by the change in morphology of the products observed at a furnace
Materials 2010, 3
4436
temperature of 340 °C (Figure 6c). This change is assumed to be the result of performing the PLA at
the γ-V2O5 to α-V2O5 transition temperature where the γ-V2O5 becomes unstable and can not form.
However, the short defective domains are observed at 340 °C as well (Figure 6d). This observation
indicates that despite the absence of γ-V2O5 bonds at the edges, the α-V2O5 facets simply cannot be
seamed properly. Thus, the nature of these defective domains between the facets and their stability is
unclear. Furthermore, while the structure of the NIF-V2O5 may be investigated briefly in the TEM,
allowing imaging at different angles (Figure 5), they are highly sensitive to the electron beam and are
rapidly damaged by reduction (Supplementary Materials).

2.2. Post-reaction treatment
4437
A prolonged post reaction treatment (PRT) was used to investigate the stability of the defective
domains and examine a possible stabilization of the NIF-V2O5 in general and the defective domains in
particular via extensive annealing. The PRT process was carried out in the same quartz tube
immediately following the PLA reaction (Supplementary Materials), which was carried out at a
temperature of 300 °C. The V2O5 pellet used for the PLA reaction was removed and the collection tray
was inserted into the furnace for a PRT times between one to three hours, with furnace temperatures of
22-500 °C. In order to prevent oxygen loss from the NIF-V2O5 oxygen flow rates of 40-200 mL/min
were used during the PRT process.
Morphological changes are observed only as the PRT temperature and time are increased above 300 °C
and three hours, respectively (PRT O2 flow rate-40 mL/min). Small quantities of intact NIF-V2O5 are
observed at 300 °C and are occasionally they appear as elongated parallelograms (Figure 7a). The rest
of the product is composed of some V2O5 nano-platelets but the main content being compact V2O5 NP.
As the furnace temperature is increased further to 500 °C mainly nano-platelets and some nanoneedles
are observed (Figure 7b). Further morphological changes are apparent when the PRT flow rate
is increased to 200 mL/min. At a temperature of 300 °C the NIF-V2O5 increase in size (Figure 8c)
from a diameter of roughly 50 nm to 60-90 nm. Such a change is observed at 500 °C as well, where
mostly needles are seen (Figure 7d) similar to the nano-needles reported in the literature [13,51].
The process taking place during the morphological changes is most likely to be that of crystal
growth. As the V2O5 pellet is removed prior to the PRT treatment there is no further supply of
vanadium oxides to the substrate. This indicates that the crystal growth in the substrate takes place via
a process similar to Ostwald ripening, i.e., one species which is relatively more stable grows at the
expense of another less stable species. When the PRT process was carried out at 200 °C (the
amorphous to α-V2O5 temperature [23]) no morphological changes could be observed, indicating the
absence of amorphous V2O5 in the NIF-V2O5 structure.
The collapse of a portion of the NIF-V2O5 product into mainly compact V2O5 NP occurs only when
the PRT temperature and time are increased above 300 °C and three hours reaction time (at O2 flow
rate of 40 mL/min), respectively. This suggests that the meta-stable γ-V2O5, which is believed to exist
in the seams of the NIF-V2O5, has been converted into α-V2O5. Thus, the crystal growth (ripening)
process requires a threshold time and temperature in order to acquire sufficient energy. This process is
enhanced at a PRT temperature of 500 °C where the NIF-V2O5 are completely converted into
V2O5 platelets.
Furthermore, it is suggested that the morphological changes at PRT with O2 flow-rates of
200 mL/min are the result of the gas flow rate exerting a drag force on the products on the collection
plate (Figures 7 c and d). This drag force induces aggregation which in turn supplies additional
material for the Ostwald ripening-like process. Thus larger and presumably more stable NIF-V2O5 are
formed at a temperature of 300 °C and flow rate of 200 mL/min on the expense of the smaller ones. At
a temperature of 500 °C nano-needles are formed instead of nano-platelets, under these flow
conditions. Note however, that a flow rate of a cold gas of this magnitude (200 mL/min) may influence
also the temperature profile at the oven.

These findings support those of the previous section (2.1) indicating that the facets of the NIF-V2O5
cannot be seamed in a stable manner and the defective domains are inherently meta-stable. Thus, the
compromise offered by the γ-V2O5 in seaming facets appears to be the optimal for maintaining the
NIF-V2O5 structural integrity.
2.3. Comparison of seaming in IF and INT
The aforementioned defective domains were deduced to be inherent to the NIF-V2O5 and thus it is
reasonable to assume that their root cause is the V2O5 crystal structure. Therefore, it is useful to
consider IF of compounds with similar properties, with an emphasis on the seams between facets, i.e.,
Materials 2010, 3
4439
layered compounds of highly ionic character. Two such cases are IF-CdCl2 [8] and IF-Cs2O [7] with
respective bulk ionicities (Pauling's [52]) of 0.42 and 0.83 as compared to 0.56 for V2O5. Figure 8
shows typical images of IF-CdCl2 and IF-Cs2O with highlighted seams between facets. It is therefore
obvious that the seaming is significantly better in the latter when compared to the NIF-V2O5 (compare
Figures 8a-c to Figure 3d).
Figure 8. (a) IF-Cs2O close-up [7] (b) Large IF-CdCl2 [8]. (c) Small IF-CdCl2 [8] (All
figures are reproduced with permission. Copyright Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
KGaA).
Thus it is clear that while the ionicity dictates the rigidity of the facets additional factors dictate the
quality of the seaming between facets and ultimately, the IF stability. Two such factors that may be
considered in this case are the symmetry of the 2-D layer and the complexity of the unit cell, i.e., the
number of atoms. The basic symmetry of the 2-D layer dictates the type of defects required to close a
sphere. In the case of V2O5 the 2-D layer has a rectangular symmetry. Thus assuming the layers grow
at equal rate along the two axes, rectangular patches are formed. Closing a sphere with rectangular
facets would ultimately require the insertion of triangular facets as may be seen in a schematic
rendering of a rhombicuboctahedron (Figure 9). Such structure would allow for perfect seams between
the square facets which was nonetheless not observed.
Figure 9. Rendering of an Archimedean solid with a Rhombicuboctahedron structure. The
triangular facets are highlighted in red.
The consideration mentioned above suggests that the most probable cause for the defective domains
is the high complexity of the unit cell. Furthermore, it was previously shown [29] that unlike the other
IF, the NIF-V2O5 layers form a commensurate multiwall structure, thus preserving the unit cell within
Materials 2010, 3
4440
each of the facets. Therefore, seaming facets in NIF-V2O5 must take into consideration the 14 atoms of
the unit cell as opposed to seaming of individual incommensurate layers of Cs2O or CdCl2 with an
average of three atoms per layer. This finding suggests that the examination of new layered materials
as candidates for IF must take into account the complexity of the unit cell and the number of atoms
it contains.
A complementary view on the issue of formation of closed-cage nanostructures from layered
compounds can be obtained by comparing (1-D) nanotubular forms of 2-D compounds. Generally, 1-D
hollow nanostructures are made of continuous molecular sheets. Their formation does not require
introducing topological elements of lower symmetry like in the case of the 0-D IF counterparts.
Therefore, the strain energy is in general lower for 1-D as compared to 0-D nanostructures and they
may be produced in a more facile manner. Indeed, pure multiwall WS2 nanotubes with 20-50 nm were
obtained in large amounts (kg) by reacting WO3 nanoparticles with H2S in a reducing atmosphere at
840-900 °C in the fluidized bed reactor. MoS2 nanotubes have been also produced by different
methods though not on the same scale [53]. Nanotubes of metal dihalides and pure V2O5 can not be as
easily obtained. For example, much work has been put into the synthesis of NiCl2 nanotubes, with
meager results [41]. Figure 10 shows typical TEM images of INT of WS2, NiCl2 and VOx [41,54].
Hints to the existence of pure V2O5 nanotubes exist [33], but again the synthesis requires a template
(carbon nanotubes). Contrarily, using alkylamine templates, VOx-alkylamine nanotubes were produced
in substantial amounts [30]. Notably, the VOx-alkylamine nanotubes are obtained by hydrothermal
synthesis, i.e., low temperature (180 °C) reaction. The alkylamine moiety plays a few roles here: a) as
a structure directing element; b) electron donating, which leads to partial reduction of the oxide and
inherent asymmetry in the structure. This leads to spontaneous folding of the double layer; c) it
introduces some flexibility into the rather stiff metal oxide framework. Furthermore, the introduction
of the template between the layers removes the inhibition for shearing the layers with respect to each
other and enables easier seaming. This discussion indicates that, unlike the IF mentioned previously,
the ionicity plays a greater role than the unit cell complexity with respect to the potential of layered
compounds to form 1-D hollow closed structures (nanotubes).

3. Experimental Section
3.1. Laser ablation
4441
Pulsed laser ablation (PLA) of solid V2O5 pellets was performed with an Nd:YAG laser (λ = 532 nm,
pulse width-8 ns, pulse repetition rate-10 Hz,~30 mJ/pulse) and O2 carrier gas (flow rate of
100-200 mL/min) at temperatures between 50 to 500 °C (Figure 2). The conditions were chosen
according to V2O5 properties-melting point (680 °C [22]), oxygen loss due to heating and the optical
band gaps-indirect at 1.9 eV and direct at 2.3 eV [55,56]. A cooled quartz collection plate (−50 °C)
placed 5cm behind the pellet was used to collect the products of the PLA experiments.
3.2. Post-reaction treatment
The post-reaction treatment (PRT) was carried out in the quartz tube on the collection plate used
during the PLA. The PRT was carried out at temperatures of 22-500 °C, O2 flow rates of
40-200 mL/min for durations of 1 to 3 hours.
3.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The product on the collection plate was transferred to TEM grids. The grids were examined with
TEM at various tilt angles (Philips, CM-120, 120 kV); high resolution TEM (HRTEM; FEI Tecnai F30,
300 kV) and aberration-corrected TEM (FEI Titan 80 kV). The products were further examined by
SEM (LEO model Supra 55 vp, acceleration voltage under 5 kV, working distance of 5-6 mm).
Energy dispersive spectrometry was performed inside the TEM (Phoenix EDAX).
4. Conclusions
Nearly perfect inorganic fullerenes (NIFs) of V2O5 were produced by pulsed laser ablation (PLA).
The product morphology at various PLA conditions was shown to be highly related to the growth
mechanism and the nature of the defective domains seaming the facets together. It was shown that
these defective domains are not amorphous and meta-stable. It was further shown that the facets cannot
be perfectly seamed thus placing an ultimate limit on the thermal stability of the NIF-V2O5. Finally, a
comparison with IF of other materials with similar bulk properties indicates that the complexity of the
unit cell is crucial in the quality of seams between facets and thus must be considered when attempting
to synthesize IF from new materials.
