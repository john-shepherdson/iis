When implementing a new type of workflow node, these are the things that your implementation has to provide:

- a possibility to **retrieve type of the input and output ports**,
- **passing parameters** to the workflow node,
- executing the node **in a sub-workflow**,
- running the **integration tests** with this kind of node (if possible).
