This project contains workflow nodes that **extract references to projects and data sets** from document plaintext. 

The workflow nodes are based on Python "MadIS" library (see http://code.google.com/p/madis/). In order for them to work, a non-standard `apsw` Python library has to be installed in the system (see http://code.google.com/p/apsw/) on all datanodes (slaves).

Python in version 2.7 and above is recommended.
